\f0\fs26 \cf0 Since the global financial crisis in 2008 macroprudential policies gained popularity. Due to the COVID-19 crisis macroprudential policy got in the spotlight again, because it was part of a policy response to \'93facilitate the absorption of credit losses and support lending to the economy\'94 (ecb 2021).  \
Macroprudential policy was initiated to ensure financial stability, because other policies like fiscal or monetary policy were not enough on their own to ensure this kind of stability (Claessens 2015). But macroprudential policies should only be used when externalities emerge (Warum??) (Claessens 2015). According to Claessens 2015 there are three kinds of externalities that evoke a need for macroprudential policy: externalities related to strategic complementaries, externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches and externalities related to interconnectedness. Arregui et al (2013) states that externalities are thought to detect and therefore some indicators are needed to notice their presence. For example could rapid credit growth in times of a boom indicate an externality related to strategic complementaries. }
