            <Text>- hey, (I don’t know if you got the memo I did for themaste thesis but) I wanted to my master thesis with with reseachrch question: what are the effects of macro prudential policy
- for this are also already have a database I want to use is the IMAPP Database by the IMF 
- this database combines various sources and covers 134 countries from 1990 onwards (even though I think I will focus on the euro area) 
- the database has 17 macro prudential  policy instruments and dummy variables and if the actions where tightening or loosening 
- Alam et al (2019) describes a lot about his so I think that will be quite useful
- I am currently trying to understand how people evaluated the efficiency of macro prudential policy 
-  most so far check the effect for it on credit growth, household leverage and house prices 
- others evaluate the probability of a banking crisis (didn’t really look into it
- and other studies check for unintended consequences such as a negative impact on economic activity
- I just got a new laptop so I don’t have stats so far but I think my next step will be to settle for a way to analyse the data and then do a table of content 
- in the table of content: what is maroprudential policy, explain the dataset, the model I am gonna to analyse it after, interpreted the result and give an policy forecast
- verstehe noch nicht ganz wie die die regression machen, because it seems to be based on several outcomes

What did you do
- try to write the section what is macroprudential policy
- try to learn how to analyse the data 
- try to get structure</Text>

            <Text>     rapid credit growth
funding liquidity risks and market liquidity risks
previous studies have shown that rapid credit growth and credit booms signal a banking crisis 2-3 years before the event
therefore effectiv policy would bring down speed of credit growth
Policy instruments that are able to lower a liquidity risk indicator would succeed in lowering the risk of fire sales (=effectiv)
out of sample analysis show that credit growth produced very low probabilities of crisis before 2007
need policy that slows down credit growth and house price growth
LTV limits
reserve requirements risk weights
         indicators
     praxis
when indictaor notices externality
need policy that slows down loan/ deposit growth
need policy that slows down the share of foreign liabilities in foreign asset growth
lead banks to take take excessive or correlated risks and build up vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of the financial cycle
Managers may be influenced by their collegues
prospect of bailout
increased competition during boom tomes applifies this effect
fire sales happens when an investor has to liquidate an asset at the same time when potential buyers are also struggling, so the price will be below its fundamental value so there will be a need to liquidate more assets which will trigger further losses

simutanous failures will trigger a bailout
maximize probability that every failure is a joint failure
         theory
guarantees by central bank might reduce likelihood of doing such a thing but it is limited
fire sales may trigger an external financial credit crunch, banks struggle and will cut back on their financing , borrowers have less access to finance and this worsens the real economy
Even though fire sales and credit crunch externalities manifest in a downturn, the imbalances that sow the risks are oen built up in booms.

            <Text>Like mentioned in the paper from XY the goal of macroprudential benefit is it to have the highest possible net benefit. And ad long as the costs of macroprudental policy are contained the net benefits increase with the effectinivness of the implemented policies. For high net benefits the pre-policy probability of the crisis (p) subtracted by the post-policy probabilities of the crisis (p*) and and the pre-policy loss of the crisis (l) subtracted by the post policy loss of the crisis (l*) need to be a great difference.

            <Title>What effect is Macroprudential Policy supposed to have</Title>
            <Text>The goal of macroprudential policy is to ensure system wide financial stability (by reducing systemic risk) and to minimize the macroeconomic costs from an economic crisis. To achieve this stability of the whole financial system, macroprudential policy addresses externalities emerging from market structure and seeks to strengthen the resilience of the financial system this way (Galati and Moessner 2017). There are three externalities that can arise which macroprudential policy wishes to counteract and justify the use of macroprudential policy (Claessens 2015).  These are externalities related to strategic complementaries, externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches and externalities related to interconnectedness (De Nicolò et al 2012). Macroprudential policy has the intermediate target to control/ correct these externalities since this diminishes systemic risks (De Nicolò et al 2012). 

Externalities related to strategic complementaries
Financial intermenditaries often chose to correlate their risk and a reason for that is strategic complementaries. This means the payoff of a strategy expands when more agents are using the same strategy. One cause for this externality is the heightened competition in boom times. Higher competition in boom times comes with lower rent. Therefore banks have less motivation to screen potential borrowers, the lending increases and the pool of borrowers gets worse. 
The second cause for strategic complementaries is that the behaviour of managers is influenced by the behaviour of their colleges. They reinforce their behaviour to each other, because poor performance is more likely to be less strictly evaluated when many report the same issue. And since their performance will be compared to others they prefer short term performance pay even when it might cause long term risks.
The third cause the prospect of a bailout. If many fail at the same time it can trigger a bailout. This means that banks have an incentive to fail at the same time to increase the probability of a bailout (De Nicolò et al 2012). 
Arregui et al (2013) states that externalities are thought to detect and therefore some indicators are needed to notice their presence. An indicator to help to notice this kind externality in praxis is rapid credit growth. The reason is because this externality gives banks an incentive to take excessive or correlated risks. This way there will be a build up of vulnerability during the boom times. Therefore rapid credit growth can be an indicator and an effective policy would slow down this credit growth.  Also the there was a moral hazard issue because of the prospect of a bailout out. So an effective policy should also handle this issue.

Externalities related to fire sales
Fire sales are happening (especially in downturns) when a sell-off in financial assets during times where buyers are also struggling, generates a decrease in asset prices. Therefore capital ratios of banks decline and they need to sell their other now underpriced assets. This causes new losses, more selling and so on and can lead multiple banks in financial distress. The imbalances for this are most of the time built up in booms (De Nicolò et al 2012).  

Externalities related to interconnectedness
Financial institutions are interconnected this means the failure of one will influence another. This means while small shocks are shortened this way, big ones can intensify. Also banks have in an incentive in wanting to become a systemically important institution, because when they are “too big to fail” they will receive a bailout in times of crisis (De Nicolò et al 2012, Claessens 2015). 

These three externalities create systemic risk. And these externalities can be adjusted by several instruments and each instrument has benefits and limitations (De Nicolò et al 2012). Which instrument group is able of correcting which externality is shown in this table by De Nicolò et al (2012):

            <Title>The Fundamental Principles of Financial Regulation </Title>
            <Text>- Financial crashes do not occur randomly, but generally follow booms
-	But why does the failure of banks, and of some other financial
institutions, involve systemic externalities that are not present when an ordinary
manufacturing or service-sector firm goes bust. The basic answer comes from the fact
that the failure of a banking-type institution, say Lehman Bros, Northern Rock or
Glitnir, weakens the other banks and financial markets with which they were
involved, whereas the failure of, say, a car company or a laundry tends to strengthen
the remaining companies in the same sector, by removing a competitor.
- There are, at least, five reasons for such negative externalities
- The first is pure informational contagion, particularly in the context of intermediaries with a
maturity mismatch between liabilities and assets
- If bank A fails, this throws more doubt on the continued solvency of bank B, when B is perceived as being of the same type as A. When such doubt arises, depositors and lenders to B lose confidence, withdraw their funds, causing a sudden liquidity problem for B; this moves relative interest rates, and access to funds, against B, making its future solvency even more threatened
- So non-banks rely on banks in a crisis, while banks in turn have to rely on the Central Bank
- This leads on to the reason for the second externality arising from bank
failures, which is a loss of access to future funding for the failed bank’s customers
- Of course, a client of failed bank A can try to transfer her custom to surviving bank B,
but bank B will have less direct information on this client, and is likely, especially in
the likely conditions of fear and panic surrounding major instances of bank failure,
only to provide replacement credit facilities on much tougher terms
- The third externality is that banks, and financial intermediaries, trade much
more amongst themselves than do other corporates
- But in the immediate aftermath of the
failure of an inter-connected bank, there is much uncertainty about how much
creditors of that bank will get back, and by what date. This will lead analysts to try to
make instant assessments of who potentially stands most at risk, and this will then
feed directly back to our first externality, informational contagion
- Forth - irgendwas mir self amplifying 
- The fifth, and final, form of externality is akin to the fourth
- Instead of, or as well as, selling financial assets to regain liquidity, and to improve capital ratios, a bank, or financial intermediary, may seek to restrict new credit extension, e.g. by rationing via higher margins/haircuts or by raising interest rates, or other costs, to borrowers. Such deleveraging, via credit restriction, will have the general effect of lowering output and prices, whether of goods, or services, or assets in the economy. This will raise the probability of default for all other borrowers
—————————
- the macro-prudential with common, herd behaviour, and with shifts in generalised attitudes to risk
- We also propose a mark-to-funding framework that (i) reduces procyclicality and (ii) provides incentives to reduce maturity-mismatch
- An effective counter-cyclical macro-prudential policy will be an unpopular policy, since its purpose is to constrain the regulated from doing what they want to do when they want, by legal prohibition or by making it much more expensive

Chapter 2: Nature of systemic risk
- If a financial institution is insolvent, it should be closed down. However, if the financial problems stem primarily from temporary liquidity problems, then intervention might be justified to save the financial institution

2.1. Solvency, Liquidity and Maturity Mismatch
- A financial institution is insolvent when its “going concern” value does not exceed the expected value of its liabilities. In normal times, when financial markets are strong, it is fairly easy to identify insolvent financial firms. However, at times of crisis, it is difficult since solvency becomes so co-mingled with liquidity issues. Prices of assets become disconnected from estimates of expected cash flows and, instead, reflect the prices that could be obtained if the assets had to be sold tomorrow to the few investors prepared to buy such assets at such time (the liquidity price)
- As long as a financial institution’s assets pay off whenever its debt is due, it cannot suffer from funding liquidity problems even if it is highly levered. However, financial institutions typically have an asset-liability maturity mismatch and hence are exposed to funding liquidity risk. A funding shortage arises when it is prohibitively expensive both to (i) borrow more funds (low funding liquidity) and (ii) sell off its assets (low market liquidity). In short, problems only arise if both funding liquidity dries up (high margins/haircuts, restrained lending) and market liquidity evaporates (fire sale discounts)
- More specifically, funding liquidity describes the ease with which investors
and arbitrageurs can obtain funding from financiers
- Funding liquidity risk is due to maturity mismatches and can thus take three forms: 1) margin/haircut funding risk, or the risk that margins and haircuts will change; 2) rollover risk, or the risk that it will be more costly or impossible to roll over short-term borrowing; and 3) redemption risk, or the risk that demand depositors of banks or even equity holders withdraw funds. All three incarnations of funding liquidity risk are only detrimental when assets must be sold only at fire-sale prices—that is, when market liquidity is low
- Market liquidity is low when it is difficult to raise money by selling the asset at reasonable prices. In other words, market liquidity is low when selling the asset depresses the sale price. When market liquidity is low, it is very costly to shrink a firm’s balance sheet

2.1.1. Systemic View Point – Funding Liquidity and the Domino Model 
- It may seem reasonable to believe that ensuring the soundness of each individual institution ensures the soundness of the system as a whole. However, this suffers from the fallacy of composition. It is possible, indeed often likely, that attempts by individual institutions to remain solvent can push the system into collapse
- In the case where we have the combination of (i) Bank 1 not having alternative sources of funding, (ii) the reduction in Bank 2’s lending being severe, and (iii) Bank 1’s assets being so illiquid that they can only be sold at fire sale prices, then the withdrawal of lending by Bank 2 will feel like a run from the point of view of Bank 1. In other words, a prudent shedding of exposures from the point of view of Bank 2 is a run from the point of view of Bank 1

2.5. Externalities – Rationale for Regulation 
- The fire-sale externality arises since each individual financial institution does not take into account the price impact its own fire-sales will have on asset prices in a possible future liquidity crunch. Hence, fire-sales by some institutions spillover, and adversely affect the balance sheet of others, causing a negative externality
- In general, a financial institution is also not concerned how many others it will drag down, should it fail. Especially the failure of big and interconnected institutions would bring down these negative risk-spillover effects on others
- What makes matters even worse is that the potential prospect of a government bailout gives institutions the incentive to become “too big to fail” and “too interconnected to fail.” The larger an institution, or the more interconnected it is, the higher the probability that a financial institution will be bailed out in times of crisis. In short, the current system implicitly subsidizes institutions that cause negative externalities on others. Hence, we will argue in the subsequent Chapter that the regulatory framework has to focus on risk spillovers, i.e., externalities

            <Text>Introduction
- efectnivness of macro prudential policy remains unanswered
- most only use dummy variables 
-endogeneity is a problem —&gt; biased estimate
Key features of the database
- database includes: dummy type indices of tightening and loosening actions for 17 macro prudential policy instruments; description of each policy action; country level averages od the regulatory limits of LTV (monthly)
- macroprudental policy can intervene with other policies
Granular Policy Action Indices
- dummy-type policy takes a value of 1 for tightening action, -1 for loosening actions and zero for no change 
Average LTV Limits
- LTV one of the most widely used macroprudential instruments 
- focus on real estate mortgage loans
-simple average of regulatory LTV limits of all existing categories in that country 
- average LTV limit series informs about the intensity of a policy change
- series provides information on the level of regulatory LTV limits
- enables further examination of possible nonlinear effects
- LTV limit series may overstate the importance of LTV limits 
How has Macroprudential Policy been used?
- LTV limits most popular in advanced economies 
- limits on foreign exchange most popular in emerging market and developing economies
- AE more concerned about housing sector 
-EMDE more exposed to vulnerabilities from external shocks (volatile capital flow and potential systemic risk triggered by sharp changed in exchange route)
- popular in both are: capital requirements, LTV limits and liquidity requirements
Emperical Strategy and Specifications
- which macro prudential instrument has more potent effects in dampening household credit growth and house price increases 
- IMaPP database enables a comparison of the relative effects of different instruments (demand vs supply side; sector specific vs general)
-also asses side effects of these measures in terms of dampening consumption growth and the growth of GDP
- policy change indicator (dummy) is cumulated over the past four quarters (and decided by 4) to account for potential lagged effects
- because many tools are similar, they consider indices for instrument groups: all, loan targeted, demand and supply measures and these are divide in general, capital and loan-supply tools
- identification of macro prudential policy is based on a timing assumptio: macro prudential policy does not affect macro-financial variables (like credit growth) within the same quarter (MAPP coefficient is there if the assumption doesnt hold)
The Effects of Policy Actions
-impact on household credit growth
- wenn man policy tighter macht —&gt; household credit raises (moderates)
- also impact house prices ( but it is in this case weaker)
Robustness Checks
- reasons for a biased estimate
- estimated policy effects would be biased towards zero in the presence of reverse causality if the timing assumption of no contemporaneous policy effects did not hold
Propensity-Score Based Approach
- empirical challenge in identifying the causal effects of macro prudential policy is reverse causality —&gt; can lead to endogeneity biases 
- reverse causality could be because LTV limits are more likely to be tightened during periods of high credit growth 
- the IPW estimator identifies the causal effects of macro prudential policy by penalising those observations that are likely to be effected by reverse causality 
Do Initial LTV Levels Matter ?
-ltv limits could have different impacts depending on whether the starting level of the ltv ratio cap is lose or already tight 
Conclusion
- nonlinear effects on household credit of LTV changes 
Appendix 2
- Countercyclical Buffere
-Conservation
- Capital Requirements
-Leverage Limits (LVR)
- Loan Loss Provisions (LLP)
-Limit on Credit Growth (LCG) 
Loan Restrictions (LoanR)
- Limits on Foreign Currency (LFC) 
-…
Constructing the average LTV Limit 
- for the periods prior to the introduction thy set the value at 100, so the treatment correctly suggest a tightening 
- simple of regulatory LTV limits reflects changes in all categories 
Appendix 3
-previous studies typically use the timing assumption of no contemporaneous policy effects  means that macro prudential policy does not effect macro-financial variables within the same quarter this can lead to an attenuation bias
Appendix 4
-panel regression in section 3
- Mapp variables used in section 3 are the average of the net number of policy tightening over the current and the past three quarters to account for potential delayed effects 
- they are constructed foe individual instruments and for groups of instruments 
- “loan-targegeted” group consists of the demand and the supply-loans instruments
-Demand intruments= LTV,DSTI
-supply loans= LCG, LLP, LoanR, limits to the loan to deposit ratio, limits to foreign currency loans 
- supply general instruments= reserve requirements, liquidity requirements, and limits to FX positions
- supply capital instruments= LVR, CCB
-MAPP index= the sum of the dummies for all 17 categories 
Appendix 5
System GMM results 
- inclusion of a lag of the dependent variable may lead to biased estimates 
- as a robustness exercise they use system GMM techniques by using xtbond2 in stata and compare the estimates with the fixed effects estimates 
- the robustness check confirms here that the baseline results are consistent with the GMM estimates, proving that the Nickell bias is marginal in this context
Quantile regression
- quantile regression helps to examine the effects of macro prudential policy on the whole distribution of macro-financial variables, instead of focusing on average effects in the baseline model 
- these results could indicate whether the policy is effective in reducing the probability of high credit growth 
Appendix 6
Baseline AIPW estimation
- in section 4 they use a propensity-score based approach 
- they chose the Augmented Inverse-Propensity-Score Weighted (AIPW) estimator
- this is the most efficient estimator in the class of double robust estimators</Text>

- Since the global financial crisis in 2008 macroprudential policies gained popularity. Due to the COVID-19 crisis macroprudential policy got in the spotlight again, because it was part of a policy response to “facilitate the absorption of credit losses and support lending to the economy” (ecb 2021). Macroprudential policy was initiated to ensure financial stability, because other policies like fiscal or monetary policy were not enough on their own to ensure this kind of stability (Claessens 2015). Microprudential policy is still necessary to handle systemic risk but not sufficient (De Nicolò et al 2012). </Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Macroprudential policy is supposed to ensure financial stability by counteracting market failures that arise from externalities that can lead to enormous procycalility  and therefore the buildup of systemic risk. Macroprudential policy should only be used when these externalities or market failure arise (Cerutti et al 2017). This policy got more popular after the financial crisis 2008 (Lim et al. 2011). 

Bla bla made it clear that macroprudential policy is needed because the other policies are simply not enough. Risk- spillover.. 
(Ensuring stability only of individual is  not enough because..). But how to use these instruments exactly and the most effcient way is still unclear. This becomes even more noticible when you look at how countries used the policies in the last year. There is not much consens here at how to use these policies (single vs multiple etc). HIER ANALYSIEREN 
 Even while implemented most countries did the tool based on judgement and learning-by-doing and not some rule or formular (Lim et al. 2011) 

There are many ways to approach the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. How does it influence monetary or similar policies? What are the costs of these policy measures (given that they often dampen the economic activity to a certain degree in a way to even out the procyclicly)? 

There is also absolutely no consens regarding macroprudential policy. Some countries use the policy tools  to target a specific risk others so it just broadly.

            <Title>Mail</Title>
            <Text>Hello, 

Im sorry for my late mail, but it took me longer to understand the models than anticipated. 
Here an update for my understanding so far:
Macroprudential policy want to ensure financial stability by avoiding systemic risk. These risk arise from externalities. These three externalities are: related to strategic complementaries, related to fire crush, related to interconnectedness. If I want to find a way to measure the effectiveness of macroprudential policy, I have to find a way to measure these externalities und find out how good the instruments are in preventing these externalities. Ways to measure these externalities are according to (De Nicolò et al 2012): credit-to-GDP ratio, property prices, risk premia, or leverage can be used to identify externalities related to
strategic complementarities or imbalances that lead to fire sales in downturns. 
According to (Galati and Moessner 2017) indicators for externalities related to strategic complementaries and fire crushes are rapid credit growth and  funding liquidity risks and market liquidity risks. 
Interconnectedness is measured in some different way so I would focus on the first two externalities. 
I would then use these as dependent variable and take the macroprudential pools as independent variables to see how effective these are in influencing the externality. So far I could find data for risk premia (average market risk premium) at statista, house price index at Eurostat and the household debt also at Eurostat. I would take the average in the changes of the last four quarters because (Galati and Moessner 2017) said that there can be prolonged effects of macroprudential policy tools and Alam et al (2019) also took it into account in their model. 
I almost finished my first chapter which I want to be about “what effect is macroprudential policy supposed to have” in which I explain how macroprudential policy is supposed to achieve financial stability and how the individual policy tools work. After the I will start the Chapter “Method” in which I will explain the methodological model with which I want to analyse the data.

 Abstract
   Macroprudential policies—caps on loan to value ratios, limits on credit growth and other balance-sheet restrictions, (countercyclical) capital and reserve requirements and surcharges, and Pigouvian levies—have become part of the policy paradigm in emerging markets and developed countries alike. But knowledge of these tools is still limited. Macroprudential policies ought to be motivated by market failures and externalities, but these can be hard to identify. They may also interact with various other policies, such as monetary and microprudential, raising coordination issues. Countries, especially emerging markets, have used these tools, and analyses suggest that some of those tools reduce procyclicality and crisis risks. Yet, much remains to be studied, including the costs of such tools, as they may adversely aect resource allocations; how best to adapt these tools to a country's circumstances; and preferred institutional designs, including how to address political economy risks. As such, policy makers should move carefully in adopting these tools.

1. INTRODUCTION
This article reviews existing research on the motivations for macroprudential policies, possible specific tools, actual usage, and lessons from experiences. The recent wave of financial crises has led to a greater recognition of the large and at times adverse real economic eects of finance. It has also made clear that existing tools—whether microprudential, monetary, fiscal, or other policies—even when conducted properly and eectively in their own ways, do not always suice to assure financial stability. Combined with a broader rethinking of macroeconomic and financial policies (e.g., Akerlof, Blanchard &amp; Stiglitz 2014), this understanding has led to a call for macroprudential policies, i.e., policies aiming to reduce systemic risks arising from excessive financial procyclicality and from interconnections and other cross-sectional factors.
According to Clement (2010), the term macroprudential was first used in the late 1970s in work on international bank lending carried out by the Euro-Currency Standing Committee at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Crockett (2000) is among the first to draw attention in public forums to the need for macroprudential policies. Elliott, Feldberg &amp; Lehnert (2013) review the history of macroprudential policies in the United States. Earlier literature reviews also include Bank of England (2009),
Galati &amp; Moessner (2011), and Hanson, Kayshap &amp; Stein (2011), and Galati &amp; Moessner (2014) provide a recent review of empirical work (for a collection of papers, see also Claessens et al. 2011; for an extensive treatment, see Freixas, Laeven &amp; Peydró 2015). Yet, though the need for macroprudential policies is now largely accepted, many questions remain, starting from the motivations for such policies.
In principle, macroprudential policies should be motivated by externalities and market failures arising from
various financial frictions and market imperfections that exist even when microprudential supervision and
monetary policy are conducted eectively (which regrettably is not always the case in practice). Few
theoretical analyses exist, however, to guide macroprudential policies this way, and hardly any have been
formally tested. Consequently, most oen, the design of policies has not started from first principles, but
instead arises from generic concerns. Related, the set of policies currently being considered is mostly based

  Even though both the motivations and expected eectiveness of various policies are not well-known, usage has oen proceeded on an ad hoc or experimental basis, especially in emerging markets. Evaluations of usage to date, mostly aimed at aecting developments in credit and housing markets, suggest that some tools help reduce financial procyclicality and lower crisis risks. Notably, in real estate markets, caps on LTV and debt service to income ratios seem to help in reducing booms, and thus busts, which are major sources of instability. RRs and targeted levies on foreign exchange exposures also help to reduce system-wide vulnerabilities. Progress is also being made using macroprudential (as well as other) policies to reduce the systemic risks created by large financial institutions.
Still, it is not well known how policies may be most eectively calibrated to circumstances (e.g., when and how much to raise or lower countercyclical capital requirements) and adapted to country characteristics (e.g., which tools to use given specific financial market structures). Knowledge on which policies and how to use them for risks in capital markets is very limited. Neither is much known about the costs of policies. By definition, macroprudential policies distort some behaviors. Unless perfectly targeted at the source, i.e., where the externalities or market failures arise, which is unlikely, policies may worsen some resource allocations. And by constraining the actions of agents, they may increase overall systemic risks.
Questions also arise regarding the best institutional design for usage, e.g., determining who is made in charge of macroprudential policies. Should these policies be conducted by a central bank, an existing microprudential or market conduct supervisory agency, a new macroprudential agency, or a committee composed of various agencies and others (such as representatives from a ministry of finance)? Institutional designs matter, as the conduct of macroprudential policies may interfere with the primary objectives of some agencies. A central bank may have more diiculty communicating its monetary policy stance when also in charge of macroprudential policy. And a microprudential authority may be less able to execute its goals when its sta needs multiple skills and is confronted with (at times conflicting) goals. Because these other policies are essential in their own right and likely more important overall for reducing systemic risks, a big concern would be if adopting macroprudential policies reduces the importance given to assuring properly conducted monetary policy—e.g., if and when these policies become a substitute for monetary policy—or to improving microprudential supervision.
A major issue, closely related to institutional design, is how the political economy of macroprudential policies will play out. By involving governments more directly into resource allocation, they (or the specific agencies in charge) will become (more) exposed to outside pressures. This risk needs to be acknowledged explicitly and addressed in institutional design(s), including accountability and transparency. Some policies may, for example, need to be presented to parliaments for broader public approval to avoid exposing regulatory agencies to political risks (e.g., of ex post not having “prevented” a real estate crisis when it decided ex ante not to set too low an LTV ratio so as to allow first-time buyers to acquire a home).
Overall, although the greater system-wide focus is welcome in light of recent crises, many unknowns and a large research agenda remain. In the meantime, policy makers may want to move cautiously in adopting macroprudential tools and prioritize the ones they do adopt and clearly state their objectives. If in the end only few policies are adopted, a key objective and possible main achievement could still be attained, that is, greater appreciation of a more system-wide view of finance in all its aspects and of the various policies that reduce the risk of crises and lower excessive procyclicality.
This review proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the literature analyzing the motivations for
macroprudential policies, considering both time-series (procyclicality) and cross-sectional systemic risk
dimensions. Section 3 reviews the knowledge on the interactions of macroprudential policies with other
policies (notably, monetary) and their international dimensions. Section 4 describes possible tools, choices,

 2. MOTIVATIONFORMACROPRUDENTIALPOLICIES
2.1. FinancialCrisesHaveLedto(Renewed)AttentiononMacroprudentialPolicies
The recent global financial crisis and its aermath have been painful reminders of the multifaceted interactions between macroeconomic and financial market developments (macrofinancial linkages). This understanding has led to (a call for) the adoption of macroprudential policies (as well as to a review and reform of other financial policies and institutions) (for more policy-oriented reviews, see IMF 2013d,e;
Eur. Cent. Bank 2014; for a review of financial reforms in general, see Claessens &amp; Kodres 2014; for policy makers' assessment, see Financ. Stab. Board 2014b). The fundamental rationales behind such policies, however, are not always clearly articulated. Proponents do not always start from the key externalities and market failures associated with activities of financial intermediaries and markets that may lead to excessive procyclicality and the buildup of systemic risk. Although they constitute proper underlying focuses, procyclicality and systemic risks can also relate to weaknesses in the conduct of microprudential and monetary policies. As such, they can arise from many factors, including policy deficiencies and aggregate shocks (e.g., commodity price shocks). These causes require their own approaches, including fixing deficiencies, but they are not all causes that macroprudential policies need to address. Even though macroprudential policies can mitigate, say, a general financial or business cycle or the presence of insuiciently disciplined large financial institutions, only externalities justify a macroprudential approach.
Identifying precisely the source of externalities operating through the financial system helps determine the best corresponding, specific macroprudential policies. Even though many policy-oriented papers, notably those by the Bank for International Settlements, have drawn attention to the need for a macroprudential approach (e.g., Borio 2003, Borio &amp; White 2003, White 2006), most have not adopted the formal perspectives of externalities. Several recent papers (for one of the first to do so, see Brunnermeier et al. 2009), however, have identified some externalities that give rise to procyclicality and systemic risk.
De Nicolò, Favara &amp; Ratnovski (2012), on which this section heavily draws, classify known externalities as follows (see also Allen &amp; Carletti 2012, Bank of Engl. 2011, Schoenmaker &amp; Wierts 2011):
1. Externalities related to strategic complementarities arise from the strategic interactions of banks and other financial institutions and agents; they cause a buildup of vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of a financial cycle.
2. Externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches arise from a generalized sell-o of assets causing a decline in asset prices, deterioration of balance sheets of intermediaries and investors, and drying up of financing, especially during the contractionary phase of a financial (and business) cycle.
3. Externalities related to interconnectedness are caused by the propagation of shocks from systemic institutions or through financial markets or networks (contagion).
Although externalities may be classified in other ways, the literature generally makes a similar distinction, that is, between externalities that are more time series specific, i.e., give rise to procyclicality in good and bad times (under the first two externalities noted above), and those that are more cross sectional specific, i.e., due to interconnectedness (under the third externality). Table 1 presents these externalities and notes specific groups of corresponding tools (reviewed in Section 4). I review the specific externalities in Sections 2.2–2.4 below.

2.2. ExternalitiesRelatedtoStrategicComplementarities
Owing to various reasons (many of which are not well understood), externalities related to strategic complementarities arise during the buildup of risks in a boom period. Historical experience suggests that financial intermediaries tend to assume exposures to common credit and liquidity risks in the upswing of a business cycle. This behavior amplifies financial cycles and contributes to asset price volatility because strategic complementarities arise in market interactions between rational agents, meaning that the payo from a certain strategy increases with the number of other agents undertaking the same strategy. Increased competition in boom times further amplifies this eect, as it impacts economy-wide credit standards. With imperfect information, banks need incentives to assess borrowers' risk. In boom times, lower rents prompted by fiercer competition result in fewer incentives to screen potential borrowers. As a result, banks reduce the intensity of their screening, yet increase lending, thereby worsening the pool of borrowers ( Ruckes 2004, Dell'Ariccia &amp; Marquez 2006, Gorton &amp; He 2008). By contrast, in the contractionary phase lower credit origination and less competitive pressures make for more screening.
Other sources of externalities related to strategic complementarities include reputational concerns and incentive structures for financial managers. When managers care about perceptions of their ability, their credit, investment, or other policies may be influenced by those of their colleagues (Rajan 1994). Excessive long-term risk taking may arise under structures that pay for short-term performance (
Acharya, Pagano &amp; Volpin 2013). Benchmarking in various forms leads to certain externalities, e.g., an institution reporting poor performance will be evaluated more leniently if many others report similarly. Institutions then have incentive to maintain risky lending, hide losses, or otherwise copy each others' behavior until the buildup of risks forces them to coordinate a strategy of loss recognition and external financing contracts (for a review, see Allen &amp; Saunders 2003). Complementarities also come from institutional rules, such as mark-to-market (fair value) accounting or the required use of (similar) value at risk models (Adrian &amp; Shin 2010, 2014). Other sources appear more behavioral, for example, when investors chase similar investment opportunities (Shleifer 2000, Barberis 2013) or neglect the possibility of rare but large shocks (Gennaioli, Shleifer &amp; Vishny 2013).
Finally, externalities related to strategic complementarities also arise from the optimal ex ante response of agents to ex post government interventions. The prospect of a bailout may result in strategic complementarities, because it may lead institutions, especially banks, to engage ex ante in correlated asset choices. Anticipating that simultaneous failures will trigger a bailout (to prevent a financial meltdown), banks may find it optimal to correlate risks to maximize the probability that any failure is a joint failure ( Acharya &amp; Yorulmazer 2007, Farhi &amp; Tirole 2012). As firms mimic each other's strategy, overall vulnerabilities increase through, for example, correlated asset choices or maturity and exchange rate mismatches ( Ratnovski 2009, Allen &amp; Carletti 2012). These vulnerabilities in turn may lead to or deepen a financial bust.
2.3. ExternalitiesRelatedtoFireSalesandCreditCrunches
A fire sale occurs when an investor is forced to liquidate an asset at a time when potential buyers are also troubled. Given limited buyers, the asset is sold at a price below its fundamental value, causing losses to the seller (Shleifer &amp; Vishny 1992, Allen &amp; Gale 1994). Not only does this asset fetch a lower price, but similar aPsRseIVtsAhCeYldNbOyToItChEer financial institutions may also decline in value. This reduces the capitalization and ability to post assets as collateral of all financial institutions, forcing them to liquidate other assets. The next round of selling triggers further losses, more selling, etc., thus creating a pecuniary externality.

  Fire sales and credit crunches are obvious options for banks because they issue liquid liabilities to fund illiquid assets, exposing them to the risk of having to liquidate investments prematurely, as happened in the Great Depression (Rajan &amp; Ramcharan 2014). Although guarantees and central-bank support, such as deposit insurance and liquidity facilities, reduce the likelihood of fire sales, their eectiveness may be limited when banks also rely on wholesale funding, as many did before the recent crisis. The values of (similar) bank assets may also be depressed when other important players in the intermediation process that do not (formally) benefit from such support, such as broker-dealers and shadow banks, have to sell assets.
Fire sales may also trigger an external-financing credit crunch with adverse real consequences. As banks' balance sheets are impaired, they will cut back on their financing. And as asset prices decline and collateral becomes less valuable, final borrowers (corporations, households, and sovereigns) have less access to finance, which worsens the real economy (Goldstein, Ozdenoren &amp; Yuan 2013). Even more generally, small financial shocks may trigger demand and other real externalities (including those from capital flows), which may be aggravated by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates (see Korinek 2011,
Schmitt-Grohe &amp; Uribe 2012, Farhi &amp; Werning 2013, Korinek &amp; Simsek 2014).
Even though fire sales and credit crunch externalities manifest in a downturn, the imbalances that sow the risks are oen built up in booms. The reason is that atomistic agents take prices as given, but on aggregate, the equilibrium price depends on agents' joint behavior. Because they do not internalize the possible eects of a generalized fire sale on ex post borrowing capacity, agents may overborrow, leading to excessive leverage and inflated asset prices (Caballero &amp; Krishnamurthy 2003, 2004; Lorenzoni 2008; Bianchi 2010; Jeanne &amp; Korinek 2010; Manconi, Massa &amp; Ayako 2012; Merrill et al. 2012; Stein 2012; for a review, also see Brunnermeier, Eisenbach &amp; Sannikov 2013).
2.4. ExternalitiesRelatedtoInterconnectedness
Banks and other financial institutions are very interconnected: The distress or failure of one aects the others. Spillovers may arise because of bilateral balance sheets (interbank) and other exposures (
Allen &amp; Gale 2000, Diamond &amp; Rajan 2011, Perotti &amp; Suarez 2011), asset price movements (as discussed above), or aggregate feedback from the real economy (Bebchuk &amp; Goldstein 2011). It is possible for a financial institution to reduce but not entirely eliminate these risks, as interconnectedness is oen beyond its individual control and actors do not internalize the systemic risk implications of their actions ( Acemoglu, Ozdaglar &amp; Tahbaz-Salehi 2013 ). Also, interconnectedness may arise for genuine mutual hedging and diversification motives (Wagner 2011). Related, as the financial networks literature (Allen &amp; Gale 2007; Gaia, Haldane &amp; Kapadiab 2011) has shown, though high interconnectedness mitigates the impact of small shocks by spreading them, it amplifies large shocks because they reaches more counterparties.
Interconnectedness externalities are particularly strong for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Historically, systemic importance has been associated with the size of institutions, but recent events suggest a more complex picture: Interbank market linkages determine interconnectedness, and high leverage amplifies eects (Drehmann &amp; Tarashev 2011; Laeven, Ratnovski &amp; Tong 2014). In addition, interconnectedness and systemic importance may be present within and among nonbanks (e.g., hedge funds, money market mutual funds, or shadow banking) or institutions that support market infrastructure, such as central clearing counterparties.
Nevertheless, although size is not the only factor, distressed SIFIs cannot be easily wound down. Unlike smaller institutions, SIFIs are oen complex, operate internationally, provide unique services, or are the backbone of financial infrastructure, making them “too big to fail” (for a review, see Strahan 2013). As a rPeRsuIVltA, mCYosNtOinTteICrvEentions in SIFIs have also been de facto bailouts, which protect creditors (and sometimes shareholders and oen management) from the full scale of losses. The anticipation of bailouts perversely aects the (risk-taking) incentives of SIFIs and other market participants. It introduces a race among

Accept
  
  institutions to become systemically important, a classification that lowers the cost of funding and reduces market disciplining of SIFI creditors, especially the riskiest ones (Ueda &amp; Weder di Mauro 2012). In turn, these behaviors lead to aggregate risk shiing and distorted competition.
Interactions between time-series and cross-sectional externalities also create systemic risks. Rapid growth of large financial institutions during a boom means procyclicality is reinforced by contagion risks. Conversely, complementarities may arise in the tools to be used to mitigate either source of externalities.
3. INTERACTIONSWITHOTHERPOLICIESANDINTERNATIONALDIMENSIONS
Macroprudential policies are not the only policies aimed at economic (including price) and financial stability. Others include monetary, microprudential, fiscal, as well as competition policies, with which macroprudential policies interact. Furthermore, the need to correct for the distortions introduced by other policies motivates some macroprudential policies. Owing to the possibility of international spillovers, both inward and outward, macroprudential policies may also overlap and develop interrelationships with capital flow management (CFM) policies. How should macroprudential policies be coordinated with these other policies? Next, I briefly review the (limited) literature addressing this question. I focus mostly on interactions between monetary and macroprudential policies because they are most relevant and have been most studied.
3.1. MacroprudentialandMonetaryPolicies
Both macroprudential and monetary policies are useful for countercyclical management: Monetary policy is primarily aimed at price and economic stability, and macroprudential policies at financial stability. Because these policies interact, each may enhance or diminish the eectiveness of the other. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2013b,c) reviews the (limited) literature on the conduct of both policies in the presence of these interactions. It first presents an ideal but unrealistic benchmark in which both policies perfectly achieve their objectives. It then addresses three questions: If macroprudential policies work imperfectly, what are the implications for monetary policy? If monetary policy is constrained, what is the role for macroprudential policies? And with institutional and political economy constraints, how can both policies be adjusted?
3.1.1. Benchmarkworld:whenpoliciesworkperfectly.Monetarypolicyalonecannotbeexpectedto achieve financial stability eectively or eiciently because its causes are not always related to the interest rate level or the degree of liquidity in the system (which monetary policy aects). To mitigate the eects of financial distortions or when financial distortions are more acute in some sectors of the economy than in others, monetary policy is too blunt a tool. Pricking an asset price bubble, for example, may require large changes in the policy rate (Bean et al. 2010). Similarly, using macroprudential policies primarily for managing aggregate demand may create additional distortions by imposing constraints beyond where financial instability originates. For example, to limit general credit growth may be too harmful from an aggregate economic perspective. Thus, when both policies are available, it is desirable to keep the primary focus of monetary policy on price stability and of macroprudential policies on financial stability.
Monetary policy, however, aects financial stability: (a) By shaping ex ante risk-taking incentives of
individual agents, it aects leverage and short-term or foreign currency borrowing (for a review, see
Dell'Ariccia &amp; Marquez 2013). (b) By aecting ex post the tightness of borrowing constraints, it may also
exacerbate asset price and related externalities and leverage cycles. Similarly, it is possible for
macroprudential policies to aect overall output by constraining borrowing and, hence, expenditures in one
or more sectors. These side eects imply that one needs to consider how the conduct of both policies is

aected. Most analytical papers to date find that the mere presence of side eects has no major
implications for the conduct of both policies when policies operate perfectly.1 In particular, most dynamic This site requires the use of cookies to function. It also uses cookies for the purposes of

when macroprudential policies are also used, even when dierent types of shocks are considered. A big
  
  caveat is that most models employ limited representations of financial systems and related financial frictions and oen use assumptions that imply linear relationships, making both policies operate mostly similar (for DSGE models with nonlinearities, see Benes, Kumhof &amp; Laxton 2014a,b).
3.1.2. When either macroprudential or monetary policies work imperfectly. In the real world, policies do not operate perfectly. Furthermore, neither policy is immune to political pressures and time inconsistency issues. As such, the conduct of both may need to be adjusted to consider the weaknesses in the other, but how is conceptually and empirically unclear. Weaknesses in macroprudential policies mean monetary policy more likely needs to respond to financial conditions. Indeed, in models where macroprudential policy is absent or time invariant, but with financial distortions still present, optimal monetary policy responds to some degree to financial conditions, in addition to output and inflation ( Curdia &amp; Woodford 2009, Carlstrom &amp; Fuerst 2010, Adam &amp; Woodford 2013). By extension, with imperfectly targeted or eective macroprudential policies and given its more general reach (e.g., as “it gets in all of the cracks”; see Stein 2013), monetary policy may need to respond to financial conditions and lend a hand in achieving financial stability. This “leaning against the wind” argument is, however, not generally accepted (e.g., compare Bernanke &amp; Gertler 2001 with Bank Int. Settl. 2014; see also Yellen 2014).
Similarly, macroprudential policy may need to respond to aggregate developments related to financial activities when monetary (and other) policies are constrained, as with economies pegging their exchange rate or in currency unions. The case of the eurozone shows the economic (and financial) risks that arise when booms are not (or cannot be) mitigated at the national level. When the eective monetary stance gives rise to macroeconomic imbalances or excessively strong overall risk-taking incentives, national macroprudential policies may need to be used, especially when other policies are imperfectly coordinated internationally (e.g., as when foreign lenders are not constrained from lending to the country).
The need to conduct macroprudential policies at the regional level in currency unions may arise not just from financial frictions, but also as a result of incomplete overall design. It is, for example, generally not thought to be necessary to conduct macroprudential policies at a regional level in the United States, even though booms and busts may be (and have been) regional. This is because, among other reasons, the financial safety net is nationally organized and funded, fiscal stabilizers operate across regions, and labor and other factors markets are flexible enough to allow for satisfactory reallocation of resources. Contra the situation in the United States, these conditions are not present to the same degree in all currency unions, including the euro. Regardless, macroeconomic risks need to be related to financial activities (e.g., a housing boom that is of macroeconomic concern, even when completely financed internationally). And when monetary arrangements are not adequate, strengthening the monetary policy's eectiveness will likely be better than using macroprudential policies as imperfect substitutes.
3.2. InteractionswithOtherPolicies
Besides monetary policy, many other policies interact with or condition the use of macroprudential policies. These include fiscal, microprudential, and other structural policies. I briefly review the research in these areas.
3.2.1. Fiscal policy. Tax policies may contribute to systemic risk when they encourage leverage, as when interest payments are tax deductible or aect asset prices (see De Mooij 2011, Keen &amp; De Mooij 2012). Therefore, macroprudential authorities have an interest in the correction of such biases. Even when not contributing directly to risks, taxes may aect the conduct of macroprudential policies. Real estate taxes (property taxes, stamp duties) may be capitalized into house prices (e.g., Van den Noord 2005), possibly making (future) tax policies relevant for financial stability. When Pigouvian taxes and levies address sPyRstIeVmAiCcYexNtOerTnIaCliEties (IMF 2010), coordination between macroprudential and fiscal agencies may be needed. However, little is known about the quantitative importance of these aspects. In the aggregate, fiscal policy also matters because it can counter (or be a source of) procyclicality.

  3.2.2. Microprudential policy. Macroprudential policies presume eective microprudential regulation and supervision. Most oen, when conducted properly, microprudential objectives will be aligned with macroprudential policies, but there can be conflicts (Angelini, Nicoletti-Altimari &amp; Visco 2012;
Osiński, Seal &amp; Hoogduin 2013). This possibility is most clear in bad times when a macroprudential perspective may suggest relaxing regulatory requirements—as they impede the provision of credit to the economy or contribute to fire-sale eects, whereas the microprudential perspective may seek to retain or tighten requirements—so as to protect the interest of depositors of individual banks or investors. In good times, conflict of interests are less likely, e.g., both authorities will ask banks to build up buers, but the macroprudential perspective will likely call for greater prudence. Some of this conflict is institutionally related. For example, accounting indicators, more oen used by microprudential authorities, likely give a more positive picture of an institution's balance sheet in boom times than a system's view would. Though recognized, how to address these issues remains a largely open question. As also argued by
Jeanne &amp; Korinek (2013), an ex post strategy of cleaning up aer a crisis may be part of an eicient approach to managing risks, thus calling for crisis management to coordinate with ex ante microprudential policies.
3.2.3. Other structural policies. Conflicts can also arise in the design of structural policies, e.g., when risks arise from how microprudential policies are conducted. For example, a very high LTV ratio is likely to increase the incidence of real estate booms. Even when set optimally from a microprudential perspective, capital requirements can increase overall procyclicality (Angelini et al. 2010, Repullo &amp; Suarez 2013). While reducing the risk of runs on individual institutions, a public safety net, including deposit insurance, can also give rise to greater system risks (Demirgüç-Kunt &amp; Detragiache 2002; Demirgüç-Kunt, Kane &amp; Laeven 2008). The use of ratings may introduce (more) procyclicality (Amato &amp; Furfine 2004). And accounting rules aimed at greater transparency and fostering more market discipline can mean more procyclicality because chances for a fire-sale increase when institutions mark asset to market (Leuz &amp; Laux 2010, Ellul et al. 2013). Also, by aecting incentives for risk taking, an inverse U-shaped relationship between bank competition and financial stability may arise (Allen &amp; Gale 2004; see also Beck 2008, Ratnovski 2013). And land use and construction policies yield significant impact on house price developments. These examples show that macroprudential policies need to be coordinated with many policy areas, in part as the need for them arises exactly from these other policies.
3.3. InternationalCoordination:FinancialandPolicySpillovers
The de facto international financial integration of most countries aects the desired use and eectiveness of macroprudential policies. Given financial integration, cross-border spillovers may arise when a financial cycle is in an upswing in one country but in a downswing in another or because countries are (or are not) using macroprudential policies.2 As argued by Shin (2012) and shown by Rey (2013) and others, there is much global commonality to financial cycles, suggesting policies are naturally coordinated. However, cycles appear largely driven by conditions in major developed countries. Thus, it is not obvious that a commonality or addressing it only from a major countries' perspectives is optimal for all countries. Regardless, being financially integrated means countries have less control over their own financial stability.
Policy spillovers are also (more likely) to arise when countries vary in their policies or calibrations for dealing with similar risks or in their policy eectiveness. Aiyar, Calomiris &amp; Wieladek (2014a) show that foreign bank branches increased their lending in the United Kingdom in response to tighter measures applied to local banks, a sign of cross-border competition and regulatory arbitrage. Additionally, when policies at the source country do not eectively stem risks related to outflows, recipient countries may be negatively aected if they cannot stop inflows. Spillovers also arise when institutions adjust to local restrictions by decreasing or increasing cross-border activities. Aiyar et al. (2014) show that, because supervisors required UK-based banks and subsidiaries to meet higher capital requirements during the
2000s, local banks lent less abroad, which may or may not have been optimal. Spillovers can also arise

  Even though the scope for (policy) spillovers is large, the case for international coordination and cooperation depends on the presence of negative externalities. Despite the limited analysis of welfare gains from coordinating macroprudential policies (see Jeanne &amp; Korinek 2014), analysis on multilateral aspects of CFM tools (e.g., Ostry, Ghosh &amp; Korinek 2012) relates. Building on this relation, Korinek (2014) argues that spillovers can lead to ineiciencies under three circumstances: if policies are beggar thy neighbor, if policy instruments to deal with externalities operate imperfectly, and if global markets are incomplete or restricted (see also Brunnermeier &amp; Sannikov 2014). Jeanne (2014) shows the need for coordination when some countries are in a liquidity trap because the global real interest rate cannot adjust suiciently.
Though there may be some (limited) scope in principle, policy coordination is hard to implement in practice (see Ostry &amp; Ghosh 2013). To date, coordination has been limited, with instruments and mechanisms defined for only the countercyclical and systemic capital surcharges in Basel III (
Basel Comm. Bank. Superv. 2011). More progress may be envisioned, but (policy) spillovers are likely to remain. For individual countries, CFM tools may then be part of a useful policy response (IMF 2012c), which raises the question of how to coordinate between CFM tools and macroprudential policies. Here,
Korinek &amp; Sandri (2014) provide a useful dichotomy: Macroprudential policies should address externalities related to domestic credit, and CFM tools should address those related to exchange rate movements. How to make this focus operational, however, remains to be determined (see Ostry et al. 2011).
4. POSSIBLEMACROPRUDENTIALTOOLSANDACTUALUSES
This section reviews first the tool kit available in principle and then the actual use of policies.
4.1. TheToolKitAvailable:UseandCalibrationofMacroprudentialPolicies
Many macroprudential tools have been proposed and some have been used, even before the recent crisis. The tool kit available in principle is quite large and includes existing microprudential and other regulatory tools, taxes and levies, and new instruments (see Table 1) (for other classifications, see
Comm. Glob. Financ. Syst. 2010, IMF 2011b, Eur. Syst. Risk Board 2014). Most tools considered to date apply to the banking system, mainly owing to the existence of microprudential tools adaptable to macroprudential objectives and related more extensive theory and knowledge. A lack of understanding of possible externalities in other financial market segments is, however, also at play (e.g., for a review of shadow banking, see Claessens et al. 2012; regarding insurance, see Int. Assoc. Insur. Superv. 2013). Note further that many instruments (can) also serve other policy objectives, including, besides microprudential, assuring consumer protection or fostering greater competition, and that other tools may be considered.
Table 1 notes the three goals of macroprudential policies: enhancing resilience, dampening the cycle, and dispelling gestation of the cycle (as per Section 3). Also included are five sets of corresponding tools: (a) quantitative restrictions on borrowers, instruments, or activities; (b) capital and provisioning requirements; (c) other quantitative restrictions on financial institutions' balance sheets; (d) taxation/levies on activities or balance-sheet composition; and (e) other more institutional-oriented measures, such as accounting changes, changes to compensation, etc. Except for quantitative restrictions on borrowers, instruments, or activities, which aim to aect demand for financing, all tools aect the supply side of financing. The first four measures are meant to be time, institution, or state varying, whereas the fih is more structural.3
Tools under the 15 combinations noted in Table 1 include those correcting (for factors that can give rise to)
externalities and market failures or those compensating for policies that can contribute to adverse financial
dynamics (such as the procyclicality introduced by microprudential capital requirements). Besides mapping
each tool to specific externalities, with some tools possibly mitigating more than one, the table also maps

tools to intermediate targets, such as changes in credit, leverage, asset prices, interconnections, and the like. Knowledge on which intermediate indicators to use and how to calibrate tools is still limited, however

  The preferred use of policies, in their extensive (whether to use a specific tool) and intensive (how much to use it) margins, varies according to the degree of amplification in the financial (and real) cycles, exposures to systemic shocks and risks, and the eectiveness of (specific) policies. As such, many dimensions come into play, including a country's structural, institutional, and financial market characteristics. Models provide some limited guidance for use and calibrations. It is possible for DSGE models with financial frictions to suggest an optimal mix of macroprudential and monetary policies (e.g., Kannan, Rabanal &amp; Scott 2009; Quint &amp; Rabanal 2013) or for some historically derived indicators of (excessive) procyclicality and systemic risks, e.g., a notion of a credit gap, to suggest specific dynamic provisioning (DP) surcharges (
Drehmann et al. 2010). And a Pigouvian tax on SIFIs can be made to depend on measures reflecting the size of interconnectedness externalities (Kocherlakota 2013).
Many questions exist, however, on which measures reliably indicate systemic risk buildup, with both Type I and II errors, and on the time horizon at which risks can be detected. Notably, how to account for a country's circumstances and characteristics is still unclear. Some factors are likely relevant: the overall depth of a country's financial system, which diers vastly; financial structure, e.g., the importance of banks versus capital markets, with institution-based measures likely of greater importance than are borrower- based measures when most financing comes from a regulated system;4 as well as the industrial organization and ownership structure, because a more concentrated system makes the application of tools easier or because domestic, state-owned, and foreign banks react dierently to policies.
International financial integration and exchange rate regimes matter as well. Openness aects exposures, both directly (to, say, capital flows risks) and indirectly, given the strong links between behavior of capital flows and banking vulnerabilities (e.g., Hahm, Shin &amp; Shin 2013; Cerutti, Claessens &amp; Ratnovski 2014). Financial integration also aects how eective policies may be. A very open capital account and large foreign bank presence make circumvention more likely. And with a fixed exchange rate, monetary policy cannot be a complementary tool. These and other considerations will aect which policy is best and whether CFM tools can complement (e.g., Hahm et al. 2011).
Preferred use could also vary according to the availability and eectiveness of fiscal and microprudential policies. High public debt makes countercyclical fiscal policy harder to implement, thereby making macroprudential policies more important. Microprudential supervision may face greater challenges in some markets. Institutional (e.g., lack of data, know-how, and skills in supervisory agencies), political economy, and other constraints may lead countries to adopt macroprudential policies in specific ways. Use could also vary with other tools available to mitigate systemic risks. Stress tests could complement macroprudential policies: Compared with macroprudential policies, stress tests are more forward looking, less coarse in their application (say, by having very granular asset categories for risk scenarios), and more tailored to (emerging) vulnerabilities. Furthermore, financial reforms are proceeding in various coordinated (e.g., new liquidity requirements) and country-specific (e.g., Vickers, Volcker, and Liikanen rules) ways, putting overall institutional environments in flux and requiring further adaptations.
4.2. ActualUseofMacroprudentialPolicies
Information on the actual use of macroprudential policies is limited, in part because tools (and/or their use)
are not always clearly identified (some, but not most, countries have adopted more explicit frameworks).
Nevertheless, the IMF has collected data for approximately 65 countries (see Lim et al. 2011; for exact
coverage and data definitions, see Cerutti, Claessens &amp; Laeven 2015). The seven specific instruments
reviewed here are caps on LTV and debt to income (DTI) ratios, limits on CG, limits on foreign lending
[foreign currency (FC)], RR, DP, and countercyclical requirements [countercyclical (CTC)]. These measures
may be organized along the categories listed in Table 1: those aimed at borrowers (caps on LTV and DTI
ratios), those aimed at financial institutions' assets (limits on CG and FC) and liabilities (RR), and those

aimed at building buers (DP, CTC).

  4.2.1. Usage of policies in general. In the sample collected by the IMF, 42 countries—of which 28 are emerging and developing and 14 developed—implemented at least one instrument once during 2000–2013, whereas 23 never used any (for details, see Cerutti, Claessens &amp; Laeven 2015). Most usage is by emerging markets, consistent with their greater needs; greater exposure to external shocks, including from volatile capital flows; and having more imperfect and generally less liberalized financial systems with more market failures. LTV ratios are used most oen (Table 2). Twenty-four countries used them at least once. Next are DTI ratios (23 countries), limits on FC (15), RR (10), DP (7), limits on CG (6), and CTC (5). Weighted by the length of time and relative to overall use, most oen used, again, are LTV ratios, composing 28% of country- year combinations when a policy was used. Following closely behind are DTI ratios (24%), then RR (15%), limits on FC (14%), limits on CG (9%), DP (8%), and finally CTC (2%).

4.2.2. Usageofpoliciesbycountrygroupings.Usevariesamongcountries(Table2).Indeveloped countries, LTV and DTI ratios are used the most, whereas other policies are rarely used. Dierences become starker considering the duration of their use. Emerging markets use more policies and for longer than do developed countries, and they tend to favor more foreign exchange and liquidity-related policies (FC, RR), perhaps owing to their concerns with large and volatile capital flows and related systemic risks. But they also use CG limits more oen, possibly because their systems are less liberalized. Developed countries prefer the demand for credit-related LTV (55%) and DTI (20%) ratios, perhaps out of concern with excessive leverage. The increased usage since the late 1990s by more countries reflects growing recognition of these policies. Overall, immediately before the current financial crisis, emerging markets used these policies four times more intensively than did developed countries, with this ratio declining to 3.3 as developed countries started to use them.
5. RESEARCHANDOTHEREVIDENCEONEXPERIENCES
The sections below review the literature on the eectiveness of macroprudential policies. Most provide cross-country aggregate analyses that investigate cyclical aspects, notably, within credit and housing markets. Other microcase studies largely focus on cyclical aspects, and some work focuses on cross- sectional systemic risk aspects.
5.1. AggregateCross-SectionalStudiesFocusingonProcyclicality
Several papers have analyzed the eects of policies on various measures of financial vulnerability and
stability (see Eur. Cent. Bank 2012; IMF 2013b–e, notably 2013e, tables 4 and 5; for reviews, also see
Eur. Cent. Bank 2014). Using cross-country regressions, Lim et al. (2011) document that some policies are
eective in reducing the procyclicality of credit and leverage. Specifically, tools such as LTV and DTI ratios,
ceilings on credit growth, RR, and DP rules can mitigate procyclicality. The IMF (2013c) also investigates in a
cross-country context how (changes in) policies aect financial vulnerabilities (CG, house prices, and
portfolio capital inflows) and the real economy (output growth and sectoral allocation, i.e., the share of
residential investment), while considering whether eects are symmetric between tightening and
loosening. Overall, both (time-varying) capital requirements and RRs significantly aect credit growth, and
LTV limits and capital requirements (but not RRs) strongly aect house price appreciation rates, and RRs
reduce portfolio inflows in emerging markets with floating exchange rates. However, no significant
  PRIVACY NOTICE
indication of asymmetric responses is found. LTV ratios appear to impact overall output growth, perhaps by
reducing construction investment, but no other policies do so.

  Crowe et al. (2011) find that policies such as maximum LTV ratios have the best chance of curbing a real estate boom. They also argue that their narrower focus reduces their overall costs. And, measures aimed at strengthening the banking system (such as DP), even when failing to stop a boom, may help to cope with a possible bust. The IMF (2011a) finds LTV tools are eective in reducing price shocks and containing feedback between asset prices and credit. Vandenbussche, Vogel &amp; Detragiache (2012) find that capital ratio requirements and nonstandard liquidity measures (marginal RRs on foreign funding or linked to credit growth) have helped slow down house price inflation in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe.
Dell'Ariccia et al. (2012) find that macroprudential policies can reduce the incidence of general credit booms and decrease the probability that booms end up badly. Using specific policies, they find credit and interest controls and open foreign exchange position limits are significant in most regressions. Consistent with a focus on vulnerabilities, policies reduce the probability of a boom that ends up in a financial crisis or subsequent economic underperformance, i.e., policies reduce the risk of a bust, while simultaneously reducing how troubles in the financial system aect the rest of the economy.
Using panel, generalized method of moments regressions, Claessens, Ghosh &amp; Mihet (2013) investigate how changes in the balance sheets of approximately 2,800 banks in 48 countries over 2000–2010 respond to specific policies. Controlling for endogeneity and country characteristics and macroeconomic policies (by including, for example, countries' lagged GDP growth and interest rates), they find that measures aimed at borrowers—LTV and DTI caps as well as CG and FC limits—are eective in reducing growth in a bank's leverage, asset, and noncore to core liabilities. Even though countercyclical buers (such as RR and DP) also help mitigate increases in bank leverage and assets, few policies help stop declines in adverse times, consistent with the ex ante nature of macroprudential tools and the challenges in adjusting policies in times of stress (e.g., how quickly and far to allow banks to reduce their capital buers).
Using data from 57 countries spanning more than three decades, Kuttner &amp; Shim (2013) investigate whether nine noninterest rate policy tools, including macroprudential, help to stabilize house prices and housing credit. Using conventional panel regressions, they find housing credit growth is significantly aected by changes in the maximum debt service to income ratio, maximum LTV ratios, limits on exposure to the housing sector, and housing-related taxes. But only a limit on the debt service to income ratio significantly aects housing credit growth when the authors use mean group and panel event study methods. In addition, of the policies considered, only a change in housing-related taxes has a discernible impact on house price appreciation.
Zhang &amp; Zoli (2014) review the use of key macroprudential instruments and capital flow measures in 13 Asian economies and 33 other economies since 2000 and study their eects. Their analysis suggests that measures helped curb housing price growth, equity flows, credit growth and bank leverage. Among the measures used, LTV ratio caps, housing tax, and those related to foreign currency were especially eective.
Though suggestive, the above-mentioned studies come with many caveats. Several struggle with
identification and endogeneity—e.g., policies are adopted when a cycle is already about to end—and other
biases, which can only partially be addressed by econometric techniques (such as generalized method of
moments). Almost all these studies face challenges in controlling for other country characteristics, including
the quality of microprudential supervision. Few consider both the use of a policy and its intensity (e.g., the
presence of an LTV ratio and its level, whether set high or low) or dierentiate by cycle phase (e.g., to
investigate whether policies are most helpful in mitigating booms or building buers for busts). Almost all
focus on credit and housing developments, but none study risks in capital markets and nonbank financial
institutions. No study identifies the specific externalities or market failures that policies are supposed to
address. Instead, they primarily analyze manifestations of financial cycles that are of supposed concern,

especially asset prices: For example, studies are less clear on how LTV ratios reduce systemic risks, rather
than control house prices per se.

  Nevertheless, both analytical reasoning and existing evidence suggest some basic directions. Higher sectoral capital requirements, such as a countercyclical capital buer (CCB) and other capital surcharges, by definition, help to increase resilience by creating additional buers. Direct measures, such as caps on LTV and DTI ratios, are likely to limit mechanisms that create positive feedback between credit growth and asset price inflation. At the same time, such caps may enhance resilience and reduce the risks of fire-sale dynamics.
5.2. CaseandOtherStudiesonProcyclicalityandCross-SectionalRisks
Country-specific case studies investigating the role of macroprudential policies in reducing financial procyclicality oen focus on specific risks or market segments and use micro data. Jiménez et al. (2012) find that DP may have been useful in taming credit supply cycles in Spain, even though it did not suice to stop the boom (see also Saurina 2009). More importantly, during bad times, DP helps smooth a downturn, upholding firm credit availability and performance during recessions. Using sectoral data,
Igan &amp; Kang (2011) find LTV and DTI limits to moderate mortgage credit growth in South Korea. Policies also appear to reduce real estate cycles in Hong Kong (Wong et al. 2011).
At times, use of macroeconomic tools is interpreted with a macroprudential perspective. Using detailed, bank-firm matched data, Dassatti Camors &amp; Peydró (2014) investigate the eects of a large and unexpected increase in RR in Uruguay in 2008. Their evidence suggests some ambiguous results. On the one hand credit growth declined on aggregate; on the other, riskier firms received more credit. They also document that larger and possibly more systemic banks were less aected. There may thus be trade-os using RR, because less credit does not necessarily mean fewer system risks (RR may still be beneficial as a macroeconomic tool).
In the United Kingdom, the use of microprudential tools over the period 1998–2007 has been interpreted through a macroprudential perspective. Aiyar, Calomiris &amp; Wieladek (2014b) show that bank-specific higher capital requirements dampened lending by banks, with quite strong aggregate eects: An increase in requirements of 1% reduced bank lending by between 5.7% and 7.6%, i.e., a high multiplier (for an early review of the eects that large shocks to banks have on lending and economic activity, see
Bernanke &amp; Lown 1991; for a review of the limited impact that microprudentially motivated higher capital requirements have on lending, see Claessens 2015, Thakor 2014). Tighter monetary policy also reduced the supply of lending, but not for large banks.
A case study analyzing house prices for Israel (IMF 2014a) shows that macroprudential measures have eects, but only over the 6-month period following adoption. Among the measures, LTV ratios are more eective than are DP and CTC. Although policies reduce transactions to some degree, evidence is limited regarding their contribution to curbing house price inflation. This study of Israel also shows that macroprudential policies create challenges for communication and accountability, even more so when loose monetary policy conditions, proper in their own right, provide opposing forces. Macroprudential policies also have social and political sensitivities, notably when first-time buyers are excluded from housing markets. Other countries, such as Canada and Sweden, have been facing similar challenges: In environments of low interest rates, these countries have experienced strong increases in house prices and household debt, even though they use some macroprudential policies.
To limit systemic liquidity risks in South Korea, a macroprudential stability levy on short-term foreign
exchange lending and a core funding ratio were imposed (Shin 2010). Analysis (IMF 2012a) suggests that
these measures contributed to a shi away from short-term foreign exchange funding, mostly driven by
shis of foreign branches toward longer-term funding. Accordingly, as Bruno &amp; Shin (2014) show, interbank
cPaRpIitVaAl CflYowNsOmTaICyEhave become less sensitive to global financial conditions compared with those of other
Asian countries. Aregger, Brown &amp; Rossi (2013) find that higher capital gains taxes in Switzerland (where

  Basel III includes a CCB, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010a) has suggested a methodology for setting it, with bodies such as the European Systemic Risk Board (2014) providing further guidance for their regional (European Union) jurisdictions. The CCB is loosely calibrated on the probability and cost of systemic crises (see Drehmann et al. 2010). This guidance suggests increasing capital if credit to GDP rises substantially above its trend value, e.g., up to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets if the so-called credit- to-GDP gap rises above 10 percentage points, with room for discretion whether and when to invoke (and an ability to impose a higher CCB). Some countries (the United Kingdom, Switzerland, India, and New Zealand) have opted to implement this CCB.5 As its incentive eects are likely limited, its value derives mainly from providing higher buers in bad times. Questions remain though, notably not only on what basis to release the CCB when the cycle turns (some favor adverse developments in asset prices, which are timelier, whereas others prefer those in credit markets, which are less subject to interpretation), but also on how to adapt the CCB when credit is a small part of overall financial intermediation (as in the United States).
In terms of reducing systemic risk of a cross-sectional nature, the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013) has agreed on a methodology for the systemic capital surcharges for both global and domestic systemically important banks and determined (and published) the individual surcharges (from 1% up to 3.5%) for the 30 global SIFIs identified (Financ. Stab. Board 2014a). Some individual countries, such as Austria, Denmark, Singapore, and Sweden, have gone beyond the Basel III standards and instituted higher capital requirements for their large domestic banks, and a number of other countries plan to do so as well. The United States has also adopted a more stringent leverage requirement for large banks, whereas Switzerland has additional contingent capital and leverage requirements for its large institutions. No studies exist, however, on the impact and eectiveness of these measures or of the CCB.
Otherwise, work has focused primarily on the identification and measurement of systemic risks due to contagion and other spillovers in interbank and other financial markets (for reviews of tools for financial system monitoring, applied largely to the United States, see Bisias et al. 2012; Adrian, Covitz &amp; Lang 2013; for a more general review, see Arsov et al. 2013). Now, many central banks, supervisory agencies, and international agencies more closely supervise their large financial institutions, including insurance corporations (as the “too big to fail” problem is still prevalent) (see also IMF 2014b;
Laeven, Ratnovski &amp; Tong 2014). Many also conduct (regular) stress tests, which, inter alia, help to identify those institutions more likely to cause systemic distress.6 Other relevant eorts under way include new regulations for shadow banking (Adrian &amp; Ashcra 2012) and financial infrastructure reforms.
So far, however, these exercises are aimed mainly at supervisory actions (e.g., asking for more capital or winding down of weak institutions) or institutional and structural changes (e.g., greater use of central clearing counterparties). Yet, they may also be linked to the use and intensity of macroprudential tools. Network and interconnection models as well as other cross-sectional tools, for example, could help with the design and calibration of tools or infrastructures. So far, however, mapping between risks and tools (e.g., how to map risk of contagion into preventive measures) seems not to be clear enough for policy applications.
Nevertheless, because these country case and other studies are better at identifying specific channels, they present advancements over cross-country analyses. At the same time, they come with the caveat that they do not control for, or allow exploration of, the role of dierent country's circumstances and conditions. Being focused on one segment of the financial system, many oen do not analyze circumventions and risk transfers to other, possibly less regulated, parts. An ideal study analyzing comprehensive micro data for many countries has so far been largely elusive.

  By constraining borrowing and, hence, expenditures in one or more sectors of the economy, macroprudential policies aect overall output. Conceptually, the transmission of macroprudential policies to financial and real variables may vary across tools (for a model assessing the costs and benefits of various policies, see Kashyap, Berner &amp; Goodhart 2011). Obvious examples include CTC and RR that may aect overall lending and output and LTV limits that have more sectoral impacts. Policies can in principle also aect the overall price-setting process (i.e., by making the allocation of resources across sectors less flexible). These eects may dier not just by tool used, but also by the stage of a country's financial or economic cycles.
Actual quantitative eects of policies on the real economy, however, are not well-known, in large part owing to a lack of data and experiences. Some papers nevertheless try to assess these impacts. Empirical (though preliminary) analysis finds that short-run eects on overall output are small, even for broad-based tools, such as capital and liquidity requirements (IMF 2013c; for analysis of the structural and transitional costs and benefits of higher capital adequacy requirements, see Basel Comm. Bank. Superv. 2010b; for analysis of the lower risks of systemic crises against foregone growth due to higher financial intermediation costs, see Financ. Stab. Board, Basel Comm. Bank. Superv. 2010). Moreover, appropriate variations in monetary policy (unless it is constrained) may counter some real costs. But these findings remain very tentative, and work on the relative strength of the eects across tools is even more limited (see Comm. Glob. Financ. Syst. 2012).
Importantly, as with other risk-based policies (e.g., monetary policy, which takes actions under uncertainty), macroprudential policies must weigh Type I and Type II errors. Analytical frameworks for assessing associated costs and benefits (as laid out in De Nicolò, Gamba &amp; Lucchetta 2012; IMF 2012b;
Arregui et al. 2013a,b; Blancher et al. 2013), though sometimes basic (e.g., Elliott 2011), may help to assess the trade-os of policies in terms of specific parameters (to be estimated or judged)—such as the probability of a crisis, loss given a crisis, and the cost of a policy decision—and thereby oer some guidance.
6. BROADERLESSONSANDREMAININGISSUESFORRESEARCHANDPOLICYMAKING
The recent crisis has led to a reexamination of policies for macroeconomic and financial stability. Part of the thinking that has evolved involves the adoption of a macroprudential approach to mitigate boom-bust patterns and systemic risks in financial markets. Many countries, developed and emerging, have accepted this new paradigm. Its objectives, conceptual foundations, and exact features, however, have not been fully determined. I highlight some major knowledge gaps and where practices at times are confused.
On the conceptual side, what the debate, and some of the literature, does not always recognize is that the correction of externalities needs to be seen as an intermediate target. Only by adopting policies that control or reduce externalities can the market failures that lead to systemic risk be mitigated. Ideally, a specific tool would be developed for each externality, though all tools need not dier by externality and can complement each other: Capital (surcharges), for example, may be important in reducing several externalities. Regardless, a start would be a clear recognition of the causes for systemic risk. Here much more analytical work on specific externalities arising in financial intermediation is needed. Otherwise, macroprudential policies may be used for the general management of business and financial cycles. This can introduce distortions adversely aecting resource allocation, undermine transparency and accountability, and (further) expose regulators to political pressures.

  deployment of instruments. Cooperation and coordination with domestic microprudential supervisory agencies and international oversight committees may be legally or institutionally diicult. Additional data are being collected: For example, the IMF currently collects data on financial soundness indicators from 98 regular reporters (http://fsi.imf.org (http://fsi.imf.org)), and the Bank for International Settlements collects SIFI data. Nevertheless, deficiencies in quantity and quality of data can hinder analyses and calibrations ( Heath 2013; Brunnermeier &amp; Krishnamurthy 2014; Cerutti, Claessens &amp; McGuire 2014).
Many of these factors vary across countries. Developing countries, for example, are likely to face more institutional and data hurdles as well as greater risks of discretionary policy implementations. Overall, the best approaches given specific country conditions and characteristics remain open questions (see Acharya 2013, Shin 2013).
Besides measuring risks and calibrating tools, additional challenges include political economy pressures and risks, which relate in part to the limited knowledge on the eectiveness, costs, and distortions of tools as well as the issues associated with calibrations, adaptations, the perimeter (e.g., shadow banking), interactions among policies, conflicts of interests with other goals, and (international) coordination. As a result, rules-based policies remain a distant goal. Thus, institutional design should allow for suicient analytical capacity and lessons to be learned. As the recurrence of crises shows, however, even with more knowledge (as exists on, say, microprudential policies), robust policies aimed at financial stability are not easy to implement. As with other attempts, macroprudential policies may fall short.
This situation makes the need for an institutional design robust to both ex ante pressures and ex post risks all the more important. Design involves determining the location of a macroprudential policy function as well as consideration of dierent models—centralized, inside or outside a central bank, or using a committee structure—each of which has various benefits and risks (see Nier et al. 2011). Regardless of model, however, transparency and accountability in the conduct of macroprudential policy as well as operational independence are necessary. Although research has addressed the benefits of independence in monetary policy function and identified some modalities for achieving it, sound governance arrangements for a macroprudential policy function (as well as for microprudential regulation and supervision) oen have yet to be adapted (see also IMF 2013a).
All in all, given these and other limits on current knowledge, one should proceed with modesty. A Bayesian updating approach may be attractive: Not only does such an approach use tools whose impacts are well known and incorporates other tools only as one learns more, but it also reduces some of the political economy risks (see also Calomiris 2013). Institutional designs also have to proceed with caution. A more gradual approach does not mean progress is not made. Policy prioritization would help avoid too much discretion and too little transparency and accountability. This path could still achieve a key and the possible main objective of a new paradigm: a view of system-wide financial stability accepted in all aspects of policy making, including microprudential, monetary, fiscal, and competition. This needed change in mind-set should help with better overall policy making and supervision. As more data and research become available, it will be possible to improve further the motivations, calibrations, adaptations, and (institutional) designs of macroprudential policies and to adopt specific ones.

            <Title>What is Macroprudential policy</Title>
            <Text>Since the global financial crisis in 2008 macroprudential policies gained popularity. Due to the COVID-19 crisis macroprudential policy got in the spotlight again, because it was part of a policy response to “facilitate the absorption of credit losses and support lending to the economy” (ecb 2021).  
Macroprudential policy was initiated to ensure financial stability, because other policies like fiscal or monetary policy were not enough on their own to ensure this kind of stability (Claessens 2015). But macroprudential policies should only be used when externalities emerge (Warum??) (Claessens 2015). According to Claessens 2015 there are three kinds of externalities that evoke a need for macroprudential policy: externalities related to strategic complementaries, externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches and externalities related to interconnectedness. Arregui et al (2013) states that externalities are thought to detect and therefore some indicators are needed to notice their presence. For example could rapid credit growth in times of a boom indicate an externality related to strategic complementaries. </Text>

The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate.
 The paper proposes a simple, new, analytical framework for assessing the cost and benefits of macroprudential policies. It proposes a measure of net benefits in terms of parameters that can be estimated: the probability of crisis, the loss in output given crisis, policy effectiveness in bringing down both the probability and damage during crisis, and the output-cost of a policy decision. It discusses three types of policy leakages and identifies instruments that could best minimize the leakages. Some rules of thumb for policymakers are provided.

EVALUATING THE NET BENEFITS OF MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY: A COOKBOOK I. MOTIVATION
1. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a unified framework for assessing net benefits of macroprudential policy, together with guidance on assessing policy leakages. The paper suggests a simple conceptual framework for comparing the costs with benefits of macroprudential policy.2 The concept of long-run cost and benefit is adopted from BCBS (2010a), albeit with differences in detail. The costs arise from an increase in the cost of intermediation and its effect on long-run output. The benefit is derived from the resilience of the economy from the policy measure—a reduction in the probability of a crisis and output losses in the event of a crisis. As a bi-product, the paper also suggests a method for analyzing feedbacks between the financial sector and real economic activity that could be useful for policy makers in general. 3
2. Existing literature has tackled some aspects of the net benefits to macroprudential policies. Most studies focus on long term costs and benefits of macroprudential regulation (higher capital and liquidity requirements, most prominently) with the exception of BCBS (2010b) that also studies transitional costs. Long term quantitative studies follow similar methodologies but with different assumptions or estimation techniques (see ICFR, 2011, for a comparative summary of different studies). Benefits are generally defined as a reduction in expected crisis costs. The emphasis is more on the effect of regulation on the probability of a crisis, and less on the effect of regulation on the depth of a crisis. In terms of costs, most papers relate regulations to credit and output through the intermediate effect of regulation on lending spreads. While a few studies mention the risks posed to financial stability by regulation-induced growth in shadow banking, such side-effects/leakages are considered only qualitatively. A review of the literature on costs and benefits is provided in Annex 1.
3. This paper takes a broader perspective on analyzing the net benefits of policy. The starting point of the analysis rests on the notion that macroprudential policies are needed to dampen the effect of three externalities, as described in De Nicolo, Favara, and Ratnovski (2012) (DFR henceforth). The paper uses indicators to describe two of the three externalities and assumes that macroprudential policies are aimed at these indicators that serve as
2 This paper takes the view established in IMF (2011a, 2013) that the prime objective of macroprudential policy is to limit the build-up of system-wide (systemic) financial risk: risks arising in the financial system and risks amplified by the financial system.
3 For the interactions of macroprudential policies with other policies, see IMF (2013) for monetary policy and Osiński et al (2013) for microprudential policy.

intermediate targets to limit systemic risks.4 If systemic risk is correctly identified and policy is successful in either avoiding or reducing the effects of a crisis, systemic risk is lowered, and the economy is presumed to be on a higher level of real economic activity in the long- run. However, there are costs imposed on intermediation and output associated with (1) higher price and lower volume of intermediation during normal times, and (2) mis- identification of risk or over-regulation (“type II error”).
4. The analysis contributes to new insights on a number of fronts. So far, the cost and benefits of regulation have been discussed in the context of the Basel III rules (BCBS, 2010a and 2010b, Elliott and Santos, 2012). Even though there is some work done on analyzing the effects of macroprudential policies, there is none that uses a cross-country database of a range of macroprudential policy instruments that are currently in use by countries (except for Lim et al, 2011 and Vandenbussche et al, 2012). This paper fills the gap by using the IMF (2011c) survey (henceforth, Survey) and a new dataset compiled by Lim et al (forthcoming). Cross-country empirical evidence is essential to this analysis, because of the lack of sufficient number of crisis-episodes in individual countries. Although the structure of individual economies may vary, it is still useful to extract the common characteristics before, during and after crisis using panel data techniques. The paper also uses a time-series model for the U.S. to derive sensitivities of real GDP forecast to credit aggregates—basic macro-financial linkages—with asymmetric effects during normal and crisis times. Last, but not least, this paper analyzes leakages or unintended consequences of macroprudential policies, based on cross-country evidence and case studies.
5. The goal is to set up the components of a core semi-structural model. The model would provide real-time estimates of the medium-to-long-term trend in real economic activity, and its interactions with indicators of macrofinancial externalities (the intermediate targets). This model would bring together the various parts of the exercise—estimating probability of crisis, loss given crisis, effects of policy, forecast of real activity and intermediate targets—into one model. Although this core model is not yet ready to be discussed, all the components are introduced in this paper.
6. The strategy will be a multi-step process, providing the key ingredients that would go towards assessing the net benefits of policy. The paper will first present a conceptual framework to assess costs and benefits of policy in terms of parameters that can be estimated—probability of crisis, loss in output given crisis, policy effectiveness in
4 DFR (2012) classifies three externalities that require MPP: externalities related to (1) strategic complementarities that lead banks to take excessive or correlated risks and build up vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of the financial cycle; (2) fire sales, that causes a decline in asset prices amplifying the contractionary phase of the financial cycle; and, (3) contagion, caused by the propagation of shocks through financial networks. This paper will mostly deal with the first and partly with the second externality. See Scarlata et al (forthcoming) for analysis related to the third externality, interconnectedness and contagion.

bringing down both the probability of and loss during a crisis, and the cost of policy (Figure 1). Then it will provide some numbers and estimates for the building blocks in section III.
7. The steps are as follows:
 When to Act. Summarize the effectiveness of early warning indicators, and the role of
credit aggregates in deciding when to act (Section II).
 Concept. Set up a simple conceptual framework for understanding the net benefits of policy expressed in terms of parameters that can be estimated (Section II). These ingredients would then be part of the core analytical model.
 Policy Effectiveness. Evaluate the effectiveness of policy in lowering systemic risk indicators (credit growth, loan/deposit ratios, asset price growth, foreign liabilities growth) (Section III).
 Benefits. Estimate the effect of change in systemic risk indicators on the probability of a crisis and depth of the output loss during a crisis from cross-country data (Section III), by extending the analysis in IMF (2011b) to a panel-logit model.
 Cost. Compute the cost of policy by estimating the effect of change in the intermediate target (due to policies) on the forecast for GDP. This will be done with an empirical model with asymmetric macro-financial sensitivities based on whether the banking system is in a ‘normal’ or ‘distressed’ state (Section III).
 Leakages. While leakages from macroprudential policies are not directly included in the core analytical model, some new findings on policy side-effects will be discussed (Section IV).
Section V will conclude with takeaways and basic rules-of-thumb that would provide practical guidance for policymakers. In many cases, country circumstances and structures will require a more selective approach.

8. Policy instruments seek to target certain market failures or externalities. While externalities are hard to observe, some indicators could help detect their presence or their outcomes. Thus policies would target these intermediate indicators, which are seen to be manifestations of market failures. For instance, rapid credit growth during boom times could be the result of “strategic complementarities that lead banks to take excessive or correlated risks and build up vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of the financial cycle” (DFR, 2012). Therefore, policy would be effective if it could bring down the speed of credit growth. Similarly, indicators of funding-liquidity risk and market-liquidity risk could be used as intermediate targets for externalities related to fire sales—a generalized sell-off of financial assets causing a decline in asset prices and a deterioration of the balance sheets of intermediaries, especially during the contractionary phase of a financial cycle. Policy instruments that are able to lower a liquidity risk indicator would succeed in lowering the risk of fire sales.

9. Having said that, early warning indicators are imperfect at measuring the risk of a financial crisis. Previous studies have shown that rapid credit growth and credit booms signal a banking crisis (Laeven and Valencia, 2010) 2-3 years before the event (IMF, 2011b &amp; 2012a, Lund-Jensen, 2012, Dell’Ariccia, Igan, Laeven, Tong, 2012, BCBS, 2010c, Drehmann and others, 2012). Even so, out-of-sample analysis show that credit growth (and gap measures) produced very low (but increasing) probabilities of crisis before 2007 (IMF, 2011b). Thus, while deciding on when to act, policy makers need to compare the possible benefits of avoiding a crisis and/or reducing the depth of a crisis, with the cost of tightening up on intermediation (and activity) now. They need to consider the imperfect nature of the signal and the possibility of over-regulation—that is, the risk that they would be acting upon a signal that could be false (a “false positive”) in the first place. On the other hand, they might be eager to avoid financial crisis at any cost. Thus, when they act depends upon whether they prefer to mitigate risks at the earliest time a signal detects an elevated risk, or they would rather wait it out and see if the signal is durable.
10. Credit aggregates are useful to guide policy, especially to inform tightening of policy, by using appropriate thresholds. Two studies that examine thresholds are IMF (2011b) in the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) and Dell’Ariccia et al (2012).5 Comparing the GFSR threshold (3-5 percentage point annual change in the credit-GDP ratio) with the Dell’Ariccia et al threshold for defining credit booms (henceforth, Boom) shows that the GFSR threshold (that tries to avoid crisis at any cost) is triggered earlier and much more often than Boom (also see Annex 2).6 If a Boom is identified, then the GFSR threshold is breached for over 70 percent of the cases (Table 1). On the other hand, if a GFSR threshold is identified, the Boom threshold is breached in about 30 percent of the cases. Expressing concern when the GFSR threshold is breached and escalating the concern and taking policy action by the time the Boom threshold is breached provides a meaningful range for policy implementation and could enhance transparency and market discipline.7
5 Although formal techniques and models provide measures of thresholds, it is always necessary to incorporate a large amount of judgment in making a decision. What constitutes a healthy, sustainable credit expansion, and what is a risky credit bubble will always be based on a large number of formal and informal observations and considerations specific to a country. However, it is also useful to be guided by common characteristics of rapid credit expansions so that policymakers are not complacent with a “this time is different” (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009) kind of mentality.
6 Dell’Ariccia et al (2012) define a credit gap measure as the percentage deviation of credit-to-GDP from a backward looking, rolling, cubic trend estimated over the period t-10 and t-1. A credit boom is identified when: the deviation from trend is higher than 1.5 times its standard deviation and the annual growth of the credit-to- GDP exceeds 10 percent, or the annual growth of the credit-to-GDP exceeds 20 percent. The concept of gap is akin to BCBS (2011) although the methods for deriving the trends are different.
7 Note that credit aggregates are not informative in signaling the arrival of crisis. See Arsov et al (2013) for a discussion of the power of “near-coincident” indicators in signaling crisis arrival.

11. To avoid underestimating risks, policy makers should include credit from all types of lenders, not just commercial banks. A case in point is the United States where nonbanks are significant players, especially in the consumer and mortgage lending markets (Box 1). Here, commercial bank credit alone greatly underestimates crisis risks and signals— neither the GFSR nor the Boom crosses their respective thresholds for the United States since 2000 (Annex 2). However, changes in consumer credit-GDP ratio (when measured properly) would have done so by 2003.
12. In reality, policymakers are more likely to look at several indicators to gauge building up of systemic risk. As explained in Blancher et al (2013)’s forthcoming “SysMo” project, different models and methods need to be combined to arrive at the decision on when and whether to act. For instance, indicators and models related to risks building up within the financial sector should be combined with asset price models to see if there is sectoral overheating. In addition, crisis prediction models are helpful in tracking the probability of crisis. Amplification channels could be explored to see if sectoral overheating is feeding into credit growth (for instance, rapidly increasing house prices lowering collateral constraints on consumption and lending behavior) and vice versa. A policy maker typically makes a decision partly based on these various combinations of models and partly on some judgment.

13. Having decided on when to act, policymakers need to assess the net benefit of any policy action on the long-term level of GDP. The paper assumes that the ultimate objective of policy is to bolster the long-term trend in real economic activity against permanent blows arising from financial crisis. The discussion of costs and benefits is, therefore, positioned in terms of the long-term forecast for GDP. At the juncture at which policymakers are taking the decision to act, they need to know the path of future output—the expected path given the probability of a crisis and the loss in output level in the event of a crisis. In Figure 3, a policy decision is taken at time t due to a signal that systemic risk is rising, and that the probability of a crisis in the not-so-distant future (as an example, within

the next two years) has grown significantly. The blue line is the forecast of output (elaborated in the next section). If there is no crisis, the long-term level of output at t+2 will be Y*.8 With some probability, p, there will be a crisis with Y dropping to Yc (shown as output dropping to S) . So the expected level of Yt+2, will be somewhere between Y* and YC. If p is high, the expected level will be closer to YC, otherwise it will be near Y*.
Figure 3. Cost and Benefit in terms of output level—Schematic Representation
14. Macroprudential policy that affects an intermediate target, like credit growth, has both costs and benefits. Policy is expected to bring down the probability of crisis from p to p* and the loss given crisis from l to l*, recognizing that it may not eliminate crisis fully but build resilience for the financial sector. At the same time, if the probability of crisis was largely overestimated, then policy is costly by bringing down the level of intermediation and

the forecast for output that would have materialized without a crisis. If there is no crisis, output will be lower than Y* by a factor α—reflecting the dampening of activity from harnessing rapid credit growth. The no-policy expected output is at E (taking into account the probability and depth of crisis) and the forecast with policy is at B if the probability and depth of crisis are both reduced; thus, BE is the benefit from policy. The cost of policy is the reduction in the trend from C to O in Figure 3.
15. This paper introduces a simple analytical way of representing cost and benefit of policy. The analysis is carried out comparing the forecast for the output level 2 years from t (in the example above), with and without policy. To present the idea conceptually, the entire future path for output (and other variables) is summarized in one data point. Expected output level at t+2 is denoted byYt2 (or Y* in Figure 3) if there is no crisis. Crisis occurs at t+2 or at
a future date with probability, p , which depends upon the levels of early warning indicators. If crisis occurs, the output forecast drops by l , which can also depend upon the intermediate
targets. If the probability of crisis is nearly certain, 1, then expected output level is (1l)Y . t2
If crisis probability is very low, say zero, then the forecast is simply Yt2 . Thus, expected output is given by (1) as:
(1) p(1l)Yt2 (1 p)Yt2  (1 pl)Y
When policy is introduced, both p and l can be lower. At the same time, by lowering intermediation levels (for instance, credit growth), the output forecast at t+2 is also lower by some factor  , to (1)Yt2 . This factor depends upon the sensitivity of output to the intermediate targets and other second-round macro-financial linkages that are expected to differ during crisis and non-crisis times. Expected output with policy is, therefore, given by:
(2) p*(1l*)(1)Y (1 p*)(1)Y t2 t2
(1 p*l*)(1)Y t2
16. For policy to pay off, the ex ante net benefit should be positive. Expected output after policy, (2) should be higher than expected output in the absence of policy, (1). In other words, policy makers should act if
(3) (1p*l*)(1)(1pl)
Another way of representing the above is:
1 p*l* 1
(3.1) 1pl10
 
12
This is a simple, static, way of understanding the concept of cost and benefit of policy, expressed in terms of things that can be estimated. As mentioned above, all the terms, p , p* ,
l , and l*, are functions of the intermediate targets, including credit aggregates. Once the policymaker gathers all the ingredients, it will be relatively easy to compute the cost and the benefits of policy. The first term on the left hand side (LHS) of the expression in (3.1) is the
benefits of policy; it increases with the difference between p and p* , and that between l and
l* . That is, the benefits rise with policy effectiveness. The second term is the cost; it increases with  that depends upon the sensitivity of output to credit supply and other intermediate targets affected by policy, when the financial sector is healthy.
17. The simple setup does not take account of two unseen ‘costs’—imperfections of the early warning indicators and policy leakages. One way to incorporate the imperfections of the signal is by including a term that represents the ‘noisiness’ of the signals or the noise-to-signal ratios (NSR)—the possibility that the signal is false or the crisis is missed (see IMF, 2011b, for NSR analysis and CGFS, 2012, for including NSR in cost- benefit analysis). But, given the wide range of thresholds for certain indicators (see Table 1 for credit aggregates), and the various models and judgment that policy makers are likely to use to take a decision, it is difficult to know how to assign NSRs to the term in (3). Costs of imperfections in signals could be lower when credit growth is starting to be rapid, simply because the source of the rapid growth might be better identified and appropriate policy applied.9 As the boom progresses, there could be cross-sectoral feedback loops (for instance, going from real estate prices to credit to real estate prices again) that might make the true source of the problem difficult to identify and to pin down by policy. The sensitivity of output to intermediate targets could be higher as the amplification channels start operating at full force, resulting in higher  . Policy leakages, on the other hand, reduce the effectiveness of the policies—reducing the differences between p and p* and l and l*. The issue of leakages is explored in Section IV.
18. The actual practical implementation of this framework will be much more complex. This is because all interactions between output, risk and policy will be dynamic, and so will be the policy criterion (e.g., a discounted sum of output over a certain medium-to- long run horizon). Besides, in this example, a binary response variable (crisis or not) at a fixed moment of time is used to describe the occurrence of a financial crisis. In a more realistic model, this will need to be replaced with a time-varying multivariate probability distribution.10
9 As was shown through a DSGE model in IMF (2011b), if policymakers mistake a healthy productivity boom for an unhealthy boom, then policies could derail the economy permanently on a lower path of real economic activity.
10 It is assumed that crises result in net loss of the level of GDP in the medium-term as in Cerra and Saxena (2008) and IMF (2009).

19. A few insights come out from the simple expression. For instance:
 Net benefits do not kick in when the probability of crisis is very low, everything else constant. That is, probability is so low that even fully effective policies do not make a significant difference between p and p*.
 Net benefits are extremely sensitive to how intermediate targets affect the output forecast, the sensitivity of which is given by .
 Net benefits rise with policy effectiveness. Policies that lower both the probability and the depth of a crisis, that is both p* and l*, have significantly higher net benefits.
20. Therefore, several empirical building blocks (Figures 1 and 3) are required to compare costs to benefits and these are discussed in more detail in the next section:
a. An early warning system that alerts policymakers 2-3 years ahead of a crisis.
b. Sensitivity of a forward-looking measure of output, Yt2 , to intermediate targets, .
c. An estimate of the probability of crisis, p , and the loss in level of output in the event of a crisis, l .
d. The effectiveness of policy instruments on dampening growth in intermediate targets, and the effect of a reduction in intermediate targets on the probability of crisis, p* ,
and output loss given a crisis,l* .
III. ANALYTICAL BUILDING BLOCKS: MEASUREMENTS
A. Baseline—No-Policy Expected Output
21. To examine costs and benefits of macroprudential policies, policymakers have to start from a baseline forecast for output and the intermediate target. The baseline for expected output without policy should incorporate policymakers’ best guess of the future path of economic activity and intermediation, taking into account the risk of a crisis. First, a method is needed for estimating the real-time forecast of activity or the forecast at time t+h periods ahead, taking into account information as of time t. Second, the probability and the cost of the crisis need to be computed. Third, the forecast for activity needs to be adjusted for the risk of a crisis (see Section II, expression 1).11
11 All of these steps can be estimated in one model but the technical tools to do so need to be developed. In this paper, these are done separately.
 
14 Real-time forecasts and real-financial sensitivities ( )
22. For the purpose of this paper, the ‘trend’ is defined as the long-horizon forecast of the level of a series. In the previous section, this is the forecast of real activity in the two- year horizon (see Figure 3) as of time t. Since this forecast is based on actual observations or information at time t, it is a real-time estimate of the trend. It is important for the forecast at t+2 to be forward-looking. In this respect, the Beveridge-Nelson (BN) concept of the trend is intuitively appealing: an estimate of where the variable will be in the distant future, especially if there are unpredictable variations in the data (Beveridge and Nelson, 1981; Nelson, 2006). However, the choice of the mechanism to estimate the trend is left to the policymaker.
23. A buildup in financial sector risk affects the forecast of GDP and this effect changes with the state of the banking sector. A bivariate model based on U.S. data for GDP and credit-to-GDP gap is estimated in this paper (Annex 3). The model produces medium-term forecasts for output conditional on the state of the banking sector.12,13 The role of credit for the GDP forecast changes according to the state of the banking sector, and the state is proxied by a systemic financial stress index (Arsov et al, 2013).14
24. Estimates of the bivariate model point to modest direct linkages between credit and GDP forecasts during normal times, but significant linkages during distress. Results show that a 1 percent increase in the credit-to-GDP gap amount to improvements in the GDP forecasts by about 0.2 percent on a 4-6 quarter-ahead horizon if there is no banking sector distress. However, the same 1 percent increase in credit-to-GDP gap will reduce the GDP forecast by about 1 percent (based on the same forecast horizon) in times of large banking distress (Figure 4 and Annex 2). This also means that if policymakers reduce credit growth by 1 percentage point through macroprudential policies, the GDP forecast in the medium term would dip by only about 0.2 percent if there is no crisis, but will improve by 1
12 The methodology combines two approaches: (1) local linear projection method to make the results robust to misspecification and (2) smooth-transition technique to describe how the transmission between real economic activity (real GDP) and macrofinancial developments (credit-to-GDP gap) change when the economy switches from normal to distress episodes.
13 Another model is the Systemic Risk Monitoring System (De Nicolo and Lucchetta, 2010) that forecasts in real time systemic real and financial risks, using indicators of financial and real activity and quantile regression techniques. This model is more useful as an early warning indicator than for real time forecasts for the level of the series.
14 The index is the fraction of big banks (17 in the US) that are experiencing negative equity returns (excess of the S&amp;P500 returns) below the 5th percentile left-tail of the joint distribution of such excess returns of all banks across time. To qualify for it to be a stress episode, the bank should have, in addition to excessively negative returns, cumulative negative excess returns over the following two weeks.
 
15
percentage point (that is, the output loss will be reduced) if there is indeed a crisis.15 The former is an estimate for the size of  (=0.002 for every percentage point of credit growth), introduced in the last section, for the U.S. economy.16 This finding is consistent with other papers such as Schularick and Taylor (2012) who find that excessive leverage and build-up in credit prior to the crisis results in more severe and prolonged downturn in real economic activity. This is also in line with cross-section estimates of the sensitivity of output cost during a crisis, l, to past credit developments (Annex 4).17
Probability of a financial crisis ( p)
25. Early warning indicators are used to estimate the probability of a financial crisis. Following up on work done in IMF (2011b) and Lund-Jensen (2012), a panel logit model is used to estimate a crisis-probability 2-years ahead using credit growth and asset price growth. While equity price growth was used in IMF (2011b), real house price growth is used in this paper, together with changes in the credit-to-GDP ratio to estimate the probability of banking crisis. The analysis uses the insights that there are “good” and “bad” episodes of credit growth and that policymakers pay particular attention to fast house price growth if credit growth is also high. What started the rapid credit growth might be hard to detect but it is more likely that rapid house price growth together with rapid credit growth could end up badly. A threshold of credit-to-GDP growth of 3 percentage points is used to detect rapid credit growth. This model can itself be used as a benchmark for all countries— given limited occurrences of financial crises in any one country’s history—and is fairly robust to different sub-sample analysis (advanced versus all economies), methods and time- periods (see Annex 5 for details).
 15 See IMF (2013) that shows modest cost of policies over the credit cycle. The difference between this paper and IMF (2013) is that the cost is being estimated for the level of the output forecast, not for the cycle.
16 Note that, for the United States, the credit data includes consumer and mortgage credit from all sources, not just banks, and is derived from the Federal Reserve Board (Box1).
17 These effects are not exactly comparable to those reported in Elliott and Santos (2012) and BCBS (2010). While the latter measure the effects of Basel III capital and liquidity requirements on credit spreads and output directly, the empirical estimates in this paper measures the sensitivities of past credit on GDP forecasts during normal and distressed times. Thus, these estimates of policy on output are indirect and operate through credit aggregates.

26. The probability of crisis can be conveniently located on a “heat map” for various combinations of credit and house price growth (Figure 5). The heat map shows that for credit growth below the 3 percentage point mark, house price growth does not have a marginal impact on p. However, for higher credit growth, every 1 percentage point increase in house prices increases p. For instance, a combination of 5 percentage point credit growth and 20 percent real house price growth leads to p=14 percent; a 6 percentage point credit growth and 25 percent real house price growth pushes p up to 19 percent. See Annex 5 on how to compute these probabilities from the estimated logit model.

Output loss in the event of a banking crisis (l)
27. Experiences in various countries show that the GDP loss during crisis can be substantial. Cross-country data for 10 countries and 12 crisis events show that GDP on average falls about 8 percent per year from the long-term forecast for five years from the beginning of the crisis (Figure 6).18 Although, alternative cost measures (as described in Annex 1 and Annex 3) are not directly comparable, evidence shows that on average these are equivalent to 7 percent annual drop in actual output from some measure of the trend.
18 Austria (2008), France (2008), Greece, Japan, Spain (2008), Sweden (1991, 2008), Switzerland (2008), Turkey (2000), United Kingdom (2007), and United States (1988, 2007). These countries have been chosen due to their long time series so that the BN trend can be computed. The estimates of loss of output from this sample would represent a conservative level, since emerging economies have been shown to have suffered greater losses than advanced countries.

28. The output loss during the crisis is greater the higher is systemic risk prior to the crisis. It has been well documented that output loss following a financial crisis, such as asset price busts and banking crises, could be permanent (Cerra and Saxena, 2008, WEO, 2009) and usually deeper than other recessions (Claessens, Kose and Terrones, 2011a and 2011b) and that financial crises are typically associated with rapid growth in credit, house prices and residential investment (IMF, 2011b, Kannan et al, 2009). Credit growth, as one of the intermediate targets for policy, is therefore used in a cross-section model of 67 crises cases to get a sense of the magnitude of its effect on output cost during systemic banking crises, controlling for currency crises (Annex 4). The model shows that a 1 percentage point higher change in the credit to GDP ratio prior to the crisis is associated with a higher average yearly cost of a financial crisis of 0.6 percent. This is comparable to the estimate for the US in Annex 3 that showed that every percentage point higher gap in credit-GDP ratio results in 1 percent drop in the output forecast during a crisis.
Blending in all ingredients: Deriving a no-policy baseline
29. Summarizing, there are several steps involved in deriving the no-policy expected output. These steps can be illustrated by filling in the blanks in Figure 1 with the models used so far (Figure 7). Blending in all the ingredients—p and l—the baseline expected output

   19
without policy can be derived by using expression (1) in Section II(B). This baseline will be conditional on credit growth, shifting down if credit/GDP growth is more rapid.19

Therefore, a country with a 6 percentage point credit growth will have 7+0.6*(6-3) = 8.8 percent below potential on average for five years, where 0.6 is the marginal effect of credit growth on crisis cost.

30. The next section looks at the effectiveness of macroprudential policies. Expected output following a policy response would take into account (a) the policy effectiveness on intermediate targets, and relate the intermediate targets to the GDP forecast; and (b) the extent to which lowering the intermediate target lowers the probability and the cost of the
crisis, that is p* and l* .
B. Policy Response
31. Different policy instruments affect intermediate targets and build resilience in different ways. This section first provides an overview of how five typically-used tools are expected to affect different parts of banks’ balance sheets and lending rates, and how some tools build resilience by creating buffers in banks. Then, an empirical exercise provides evidence on the effectiveness of these tools on intermediate targets.20
20 See CGFS (2012) for schematic diagrams on the policy transmission mechanisms of each tool.
 
21
Policy to Intermediate Targets: What to Expect
32. Tools can be classified according to the portion of financial institution’s balance sheets they directly affect. For instance, risk weights, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) and dynamic provisions have a direct impact on the economic capital, reserve requirements on the funding structure, and Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income (DTI) on assets (Table 2). In addition to building buffers and creating resilience against various risks, the tools are expected to affect intermediate targets. Some tools could have immediate effect on credit growth, for instance, either through quantitative restrictions enforced through eligibility criteria or through prices like lending rates. The pricing effects are analyzed using the loan-pricing equation introduced in Elliott and Santos (2012) and described in Box 2. The underlying assumption is that a unit of loan should provide sufficient return to cover cost of equity, debt and deposits backing the loan adjusted for expected losses on the loan and other incidental costs.
33. Capital based tools. Risk weights have typically been increased on assets such as mortgage loans fearing property price booms, loans to other overheating sectors, or foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers. These can be flexibly imposed; for instance, risk weights can be increased on the stock of existing loans or on the flow of new loans. An increase in risk-weighted assets (RWA) makes them more expensive (raising equity is costly) if capital ratios are not allowed to decline. The negative effect on credit growth of higher RWA could be through higher lending rates, as banks recuperate the cost of raising new equity. Countercyclical capital buffers (CCB) could have similar effects except that these buffers may not be as well targeted as the RWA. Some of the loan pricing effects could be offset by investors’ requiring lower return on capital due to the perception of higher resilience in the banking sector due to the higher capital buffers.
34. Reserve requirements (RR). Countries use RRs on various funding instruments to build liquidity buffers against risky sources of funds. The base for the RRs varies from certain deposits to foreign liabilities to wholesale funds, either on the stock or their flows. Since it restricts the funding available to back new loans and requires setting aside assets as reserves, there is less to lend and could have a direct effect on credit growth and loan/deposit ratio. In addition to the quantitative restriction, the increase could lead to higher lending rates as the cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt or deposits.
35. Loan-to-Value and Debt-to-Income Requirements. Both LTV and DTI tools impact the flow of new loans by tightening eligibility criteria and are quantitative tools that could limit mortgage credit growth and house price growth. Lower LTV and DTI imply that new borrowers who are not eligible are excluded from loan markets and eligible ones have to borrow less (put more down-payment). This is equivalent to a direct reduction in the flow of credit. Having more equity at stake, borrowers are discouraged from defaulting on their loan. From a risk management perspective and under the Basel II advanced approach, the reduction in borrowers’ probability of default affects the loss probability distribution of loan portfolios, lowering expected and unexpected losses. The lower expected and unexpected losses then lead to a decline in loan loss provisions—if they are forward-looking—and capital, respectively. A reduction in expected losses implies lower credit spreads and, therefore, lending rates as shown in the loan pricing equation in Box 2. In turn, a reduction in

22
unexpected losses increases the risk-based capital ratios and would initially have no impact on lending rates. However, if banks react to the lower unexpected losses by reducing capital to keep capital ratios constant, the cost of capital funding a loan would fall, further magnifying the negative effect on lending rates arising from expected losses. It is usually expected that the negative quantitative impact on credit growth and house prices is not offset by the lowering of lending rates on eligible borrowers.
36. Dynamic provisioning. This is another tool that discourages credit growth with a pricing effect on lending rates. Dynamic provisioning rules tend to set a buffer—general provisions—against fluctuations in specific provisions for loan losses, which are currently driven by the “incurred loss” approach that recognizes loan impairment when there is objective evidence of incurred losses. 21 This leads to fluctuations in provisions and an overstatement of income during the upswings in the economic cycle.22 To offset cyclical fluctuations in specific provisions, general provisions increase during the upswings and decline during the downswings. They are booked as either on the liability side of the balance sheet—associated with a reduction in net income—or part of shareholder’s equity— associated with a reduction in distributed dividends. As a result, general provisions could lead to an increase in the cost of capital and lending rates.
 21 Even though the expected loss approach has a strong forward-looking component, it may still lead to procyclical provisions. If the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD), and the exposure at default (EAD) parameters are calibrated at a point in time (PIT) but not through the cycle (TTC), expected losses will decline during upswings and increase during downswings in economic activity, also leading to cyclical movement in lending rates.
22 The forthcoming accounting changes that focus on the expected loss approach will change the nature of provisions by recognizing upfront expected losses, which could be helpful from a macroprudential perspective.

Policy to Intermediate Targets: Empirical Evidence
37. Actual experience with macroprudential policy instruments, featured in the Survey, shows that policy can be effective on intermediate targets. The Survey (IMF, 2011c) and its extension by Lim et al (forthcoming) provides a novel dataset to understand policy effectiveness. The instruments used from the survey are loan-to-value (LTV) limits, debt-to-income (DTI) limits, reserve requirements, provisioning and altering risk-weights on regulatory capital. Unlike previous studies (BCBS, 2010a, Roger and Vlcek, 2011), this paper estimates both the direct and indirect impact of policy instruments on intermediate targets, rather than looking only at the effect on loan-spreads.23, 24
38. The results show that certain policies could successfully bring down indicators related to two externalities. Dynamic panel regressions of the intermediate target on its own lag, some controls and the policy variable are estimated over 2000Q1-2011Q4 for countries that used the macroprudential policy measure in place (see Annex 4 for details and Figure 9 for a summary). The effects of the macroprudential instruments are over and above the effects of the policy interest rate or the lending rate and growth in aggregate demand (proxied by GDP growth).
 During the period when LTV limits, reserve requirements and risk weights are applied, credit growth and house price growth—intermediate targets related to the “correlated-risk-taking” externality—slow down; provisioning policy is not significant always (probably because very few countries have used it).
 Moreover, DTI limits are powerful in slowing down loan/deposit growth and the share of foreign liabilities in foreign asset growth—intermediate targets related to “fire-sale” externality.
 While RR also works on lowering loan-deposit ratio growth, risk weights and LTV have had on average larger effects on foreign asset-liability mismatches.
These results are similar in spirit to those in Lim et al (2011) that show how policies reduce the correlation between credit growth and GDP growth, but go further in showing the direct
23 This is because, loan-spread data cannot be easily comparable across countries, is very imprecise given the mix of currencies in which loans are originated in certain countries, and may not be the only channel through which policies might affect intermediate targets. There could be direct effects through tightening of lending standards and terms and conditions of lending that are not always observed in loan-spreads.
24 The Survey data only starts in 2000, which makes it difficult to use it for relating policy instruments to the probability of crisis.
 
25
effects on banking aggregates that could be considered as intermediate targets for combating the two externalities (Figure 9).25
39. Moreover, the policies have prolonged impacts. The dynamic structure of the estimation method allows one to gauge both the short-term and the medium-term impacts of the policy measures on intermediate targets (Figure 9).
 Taking the correlated-risk taking externality: higher capital requirements, on average, have historically lowered credit growth by about 1 percentage point on impact and by 5 percentage points cumulatively in two years; and lowered house price growth by 1 percentage point in the short-term and by 6 percentage points in two years.
 For the fire sales externality, tighter DTIs seem to work towards lowering the asset- liability funding mismatches.
 Capital requirements have cut across both the externalities, and have been effective in three of the four intermediate targets featured here. RRs have been effective in having a prolonged impact on house price growth and loan-deposit growth.
40. During the upswing, both capital and reserve requirements can build buffers but the quality of this buffer matters. This is especially true for capital requirements; capital ratios are generally buoyant during booms due to high profitability (DFR, 2012) but what could be binding for banks (going forward as Basel III takes effect) is the need to raise the quality of the loss-absorbing buffer (IMF, 2012a, BCBS, 2011b). Ensuring higher quality (as mandated in Basel III) together with the quantity would be costlier for banks and have a larger effect on intermediate targets than is shown here, creating greater resilience in the banking system.
 25 A variation of the model for policy effectiveness is presented in IMF (2013), which also includes effects on real economic activity, differentiating the effects in busts. See Scarlata et al (forthcoming) for analysis and policies against the third externality: contagion and cross-section risks.

From intermediate targets to lowering probability and depth of crisis: p* and l*
41. Tighter policy affects intermediate targets that, in turn, lower the probability and depth of output loss in case of crisis. Tighter capital requirements, such as through higher risk weights seems to have had a higher medium term impact on credit growth historically than other policies. However, since the policy instrument is a categorical variable in the empirical work (that is, a tightening is denoted by 1, a loosening by -1, see Annex 6), the results need to be interpreted carefully. Table 3 illustrates the effects of policy tightening on credit and house price growth, and their effects on p*, l* and α. It is assumed that the probability of crisis is 14 percent and the loss given crisis is 9.2 percent given credit and house price growth in the baseline. Tightening of capital requirements by raising risk weights, on average across time and countries, would reduce the credit-to-GDP ratio growth by a little more than 1 percentage point on impact and 5 percentage point in two years (see Figure 9). In addition, real house price growth would be reduced by 5.8 percent over two years. The reduction in credit and house price growth would together reduce the probability of crisis to 3 percent and the loss given crisis to 5 percent.
42. In reality, it depends upon how much risk weights usually change compared to other instruments. Also, higher risk weights, which are applied to the whole stock of credit in a certain category, are costly for banks and are more likely to be transferred to customers through higher credit spreads or other forms of tightening of credit conditions (including DTI limits). In contrast, DTIs have an impact on credit growth only if they are binding on the flow of new customers.
43. These responses are likely to be higher in practice. So far, the impacts have been discussed from the point of view of reducing credit growth and house price growth, which are two of the many intermediate targets. In reality, capital requirements and provisions build buffers that increase resilience of the system. They also affect other things like foreign liabilities growth, which together with credit, would have a multiplicative effect on p*. In addition, there could be positive confidence effects on the banking sector that would reduce crisis risk, which is difficult to capture in the same framework.
44. Policy costs depend upon the sensitivity of the output forecast to intermediate targets, had there been no crisis. If risks were mis-measured and crisis–risks were actually zero, then the tightened policy lowers the GDP forecast level only modestly for the United States, compared to the no-crisis, no-policy level. For instance, continuing the example in Table 3, if a crisis did not occur, the GDP forecast would be reduced by (α) 1 percent, a relatively high number since capital requirements have a large effect on intermediation.
45. Summarizing, the various ingredients can now be mixed together to get the net benefits of policy. The various components are summarized in Figure 10, filling in the missing pieces. These pieces can be used to evaluate the net benefits of policy using the concept in Section II as guidance. For instance, for the example in Table 3 (risk weights),

29
together with the other ingredients, the net benefit of policy is still positive. Of course, these estimates need to be mixed with a lot of judgment as was noted earlier. Depending on the structure of the financial sector, policy leakages are also important considerations, which are analyzed in the next section.

IV. LEAKAGES
46. Macroprudential policies could have unintended side-effects, besides the intended costs and benefits, through leakages. Where incentives for risk-taking still exists, market players other than the institutions on which policies are imposed, will attempt to make full use of it. Leakages exist when there is a disconnect between the supervision and regulation of financial entities and the actual activities and the forms of intermediation of these entities. When policies clamp down on banking activities, other institutions pick up the slack. When policies restrict local operations, either the entities spread risks elsewhere or crossborder and other nonbank intermediation substitutes for the restricted or regulated activity.
47. There could be other unintended consequences of macroprudential policies. First, migration of activities to the shadow banking sector make it difficult to identify systemic risk (see Boxes 1, 3 and 4). For instance, the extent of leverage can be hidden by shadow banking activities, or could be vulnerable to long intermediation chains. Second, application of tools can lead to structural distortions in the financial system that at first sight might seem innocuous but over time could have systemic implications. For example, there are some early signs of higher securitization rates and greater reliance on wholesale funding to cover the higher costs of Basel III capital rules (IMF, 2012b). Third, the policies applied in one country to address its systemic risk can have unintended consequences of risk-shifting to other countries.
48. The focus here will be on new findings related to crossborder leakages and the shadow banking system. Crossborder arbitrage through direct crossborder lending and regulatory arbitrage through the part of the domestic financial sector falling outside the banking regulatory perimeter are two core channels of leakages. The growing literature on shadow banks in advanced economies (see Claessens et al, 2012 for a survey) and opportunities of direct crossborder credit in emerging economies (Enoch and Ötker-Robe, 2007) create good starting points for analysis. There can be many other avenues for leakages (see CGFS, 2012, Santos and Elliott, 2012, BOE, 2011), but these are beyond the scope of this paper due to data limitations.
 In many countries, especially in emerging Europe, there were large crossborder flows into banks and nonbanks. The flows into banks were mostly from foreign parent banks into their subsidiaries, which took advantage of the growth opportunities and competed for market share with other foreign banks. Tightening of local regulatory policies often led the parent banks to lend directly to the private sector. As in Croatia (Box 3), direct crossborder lending growth accelerated with tightening of local macroprudential policies.
 The other source of leakage considered in this paper is the part of the financial sector that compete with the regulated banking sector but are subject to home country regulatory policies only, such as foreign bank branches in the U.K. (Box 4).

31
 The third kind of leakage is through nonbank financial institutions within the domestic financial sector that are either unregulated or not given the same regulatory treatment as banks. The latter case is illustrated by the example of the United States (Box 1).
Direct Crossborder Loans
49. Empirical findings suggest that certain macroprudential instruments are more prone to leakages from crossborder loans than others. Re-estimating the panel data model on policy instruments, using data on direct crossborder loans to the private sector as the dependent variable, reserve requirements and provisioning policies tend to incentivize foreign banks to directly lend to the private sector, bypassing the subsidiaries (Annex 6).26 The evidence suggests that a tightening of reserve requirements reduces credit growth by 0.4- 0.5 of a percentage point on impact but increases leakages through higher crossborder lending growth by 1.2 percentage points. Over two years, credit growth decreases by 2.5 percentage points, and direct crossborder loan grows by about 5 percentage points. Local bank provisioning policies, as was shown earlier, did not have significant impacts on credit aggregates, but does attract direct crossborder flows.
50. There could be multiple reasons for RRs to increase leakages. Reserve requirements are imposed on banks’ liabilities. If these liabilities are foreign, coming from banks’ foreign parents, additional requirements are easily circumvented by providing direct crossborder loans to the private sector instead of channeling funds through branches. RR would still have an effect (the ‘stock effect’) on credit growth from the domestic banking system, since banks are squeezed on the amount of liabilities that are available for lending. Capital requirements like higher risk weights, on the other hand, still require additional capital injections by parents or lower profit distributions that tightens the parents’ belts—the foreign parents can only direct additional funds through capital injections into subsidiaries, which are not substitutable for direct crossborder lending.
51. LTV and DTI limits, on the other hand, are part of eligibility criteria and influence loan demand. If binding, these limits help to decrease demand for certain loans, like mortgage credit. If parent banks also perceive these limits as hard limits for their own risk management, there should be less crossborder substitution of credit due to domestic regulation. Another argument for the empirical evidence is that LTV and DTI are, in most cases, applied to mortgage loans to households. Hence, it is difficult to substitute (for households) domestic loans with a foreign loan because usually households do not have an
26 The data used for crossborder lending comprise (changes in) two specific series from IMF’s BOP statistics, Other Investment (OI) Liabilities, Net: OI Currency and Deposits Other Sectors LB—BPTSTSUB 9148784..9... and OI Loans Other Sectors LB—BPTSTSUB 9148775..9...
 
32
access to a foreign market and a foreign parent bank does not have a mechanism to take over the house in case of default.
52. Therefore, the findings suggest that in financially open economies, capital requirements and LTV tools could be better suited to limit buildup in credit-related risks than reserve requirements. This is especially true in economies with high foreign- ownership of the banking system and where foreign parents are willing to work with the local subsidiaries in order to get information on local clients. Having said that, there are many different kinds of RRs that the empirical work lumps into one: RRs based on the foreign currency component of liabilities, maintenance of the reserves in local versus foreign currency, marginal versus average reserve requirements, etc. Thus, some RRs might be more prone to leakages than others, but such distinction are not individually testable given current data limitations and are beyond the scope of this paper.
Foreign Branches and Nonbank Financial Institutions
53. The other leakage is related to the presence of financial institutions that are not regulated the same way as banks but offer banking services. As regulations on banks are tightened, other credit intermediaries like branches of foreign banks (that are regulated by the home country as in the United Kingdom), leasing and factoring companies and other finance companies, and investment banks (as in the United States in Box 1) take on commercial bank activities.
54. The foreign bank branches in the U.K. provide a relevant case. Empirical work shows that when capital requirements are tightened for the U.K. banks, loan supply significantly diminishes. However, about a third of the effect is offset by foreign branches in the U.K. (Box 4). Thus, any tightening in capital requirements would have to be coordinated with the home supervisor of the foreign branches, so that they tighten capital requirements for U.K. exposures as well.
55. The significant nonbank activity in the United States provides another case. In most countries, the bulk of consumer lending is done by banks. However, the United States stands out as having a large share of intermediation occurring in nonbanks or shadow banks (Box 1). As was shown earlier, measures of ‘excesses’ based on bank credit in the United States failed to signal a crisis when the two thresholds for credit growth (IMF, 2011b and Dell’Ariccia et al, 2012) were used. Using consumer credit growth from all sources of intermediation breaches atleast one threshold early in the 2000s and would have signaled a crisis. Like the case of bank branches in the United Kingdom, nonbanks in the United States are likely to circumvent macroprudential policies, if these policies are aimed just at banks.
56. In such cases, LTV and DTI limits together with capital requirements could work better. Borrower eligibility criteria can be applied to all products (rather than institutions) that are offered by any financial institution within a country. In the U.K. where there is evidence of leakage of capital requirements, LTV and DTI limits could be applied

33
even to foreign branches (BOE, 2011). That way, at least the ‘flow’ part of the credit supply is controlled. The ‘stock’ of credit that was supplied with high LTVs, however, remains unprotected. One way to take care of the stock problem is to have higher risk weights on high-LTV loans made in the past—but to be effective, foreign parents of the branches would also need to follow the rules set by the host supervisor and regulator. For nonbank activity, close coordination with other regulators would be needed.
57. Summarizing, there are three sets of policy implications to counter leakages, depending upon the financial structure of the economy.
 Financially open economies, especially with foreign subsidiaries: capital tools and LTV could work well for containing the “correlated risks” externality. RRs are subject to leakages through substitution of direct crossborder lending for domestic lending. Since both DTIs and RRs are usually effective at containing funding risks (loan/deposit growth)—one of the targets against the “fire sales” externality—DTI limits could be used instead or with RRs.
 Financial systems with foreign bank branches: A combination of LTV and DTI could work well in containing risks from both externalities as they apply to the activity not the institution. Capital tools could be problematic for universal use. In this case, RRs could also help if these can be applied to branches.
 Financial systems with a large share of nonbanks: As with branches, combinations of LTV and DTI tools could work, in close coordination with other regulators. For consumer credit, the macroprudential supervisor could coordinate with the consumer protection agency if one exists. Both capital tools and RRs would be difficult to impose in such financial systems.
58. In general, a number of standard policy prescriptions apply to plug evasions and circumventions. Regulating financial services, not sectors; strengthening (macroprudential) regulation of the (shadow) banking sector (FSB, 2013); coordinating macroprudential tools and ensuring their consistent application across borders including through reciprocity principles; monitoring arbitrage opportunities on a regular basis (CGFS, 2012) and dealing with data gaps are all potentially valuable methods of reducing systemic risks.
V. SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
59. This paper has provided a recipe for estimating cost, benefits and unintended consequences of macroprudential policies. The idea is to provide guidance to policymakers and new findings on the various components of the decision making process. In this respect, the paper provides a conceptual framework for analyzing costs and benefits. It takes forward existing studies and uses them in order to come up with simple rules-of-thumb based on additional empirical work. It provides new evidence on the effectiveness of different policy

34
instruments using a database from a survey and provides new findings on the unintended consequences of macroprudential policies.
60. The work remains under construction. While many of the ingredients are provided in this paper, there remains work to be done on the core analytical model that blends together all the components. While the structure of the model is clear, its estimation remains complicated and subject to robustness tests. So far, the paper takes an incremental approach to integrating the various ingredients in the cost-benefit framework. The core model, which is left to another paper, would be expected to estimate the output forecast taking into account a dynamic interaction between output, risk and policy.
61. Summarizing, for macroprudential policy to work, the ex ante benefits should be higher than the cost. Even though this is work in progress, there are useful insights already resulting from the analysis. Net benefits would depend upon several things.
 Most important is the performance of the early warning models. If a dependable set of indicators is not used, mis-use of macroprudential policies could be costly. As IMF (2012a) showed, there are adverse growth outcomes if financial buffers are too high, especially for emerging economies. What matters is the quality of the buffers.
 Given the widespread role of credit in early warning, policy makers could use two thresholds provided in IMF (2011b) and Dell’Ariccia et al (2012) respectively, escalating the concern and implementing corrective policies somewhere in between the two thresholds (Table 1, section II, Annex 2). That way, policymakers use judgment together with analytical results in their policy decision. This gradual approach could also influence expectations of the private sector that could mitigate the necessity of drastic and severe policy responses.
 Policymakers need proper measures of the intermediate target: not just bank credit but all sources of credit. The latter data would feed into the performance of the early warning models and indicators. As is shown for the U.S. case in Box 1, the out-of- sample probability of crisis in the 2000s is much higher when all sources of consumer credit are used rather than just bank credit.
 Net benefits do not kick in when the probability of crisis is so low that even fully effective policies do not make a significant difference between pre- and post-policy probabilities of crisis (section II). In this regard, the probability of crisis increases non-linearly when, for instance, both house prices and credit are growing rapidly, especially when credit-to-GDP ratio is growing by 3 percentage points of GDP or more (Figure 5).
 Net benefits are very sensitive to how intermediate targets affect the output forecast. If macro-financial linkages are high, output is highly sensitivity to

35
intermediation. In such cases, policy mistakes, especially when policy over-reacts to signals (“false positives”), could be very costly. However, so far, these effects have been estimated to be very modest for the Untied States (Annex 3). If policy measures are taken and there is no crisis, the output forecast drops by 0.2 percent for every 1 percentage point tightening of credit growth.
 Net benefits rise with policy effectiveness as long as the costs are contained. For benefits to be high, the difference between pre- and post-policy probabilities of crisis (p and p*) and the pre- and post-policy loss given crisis (l and l*) need to be large (Section II).
 The measures that are most effective and have prolonged effects on credit growth and house price growth are reserve requirements, higher risk weights on capital and LTV limits. Provisioning policies have not been tried in many countries, but where data is available, these did not have significant effects. By influencing both asset prices and credit growth, the three instruments could lower the probability of crisis and its depth substantially to increase the benefits of policy. Historically, the use of LTVs seems to have less bite than capital requirements and RRs (Section III, Annex 6).
 Since there is evidence of leakages or unintended consequences of some policies, policymakers should pay attention to the financial structure of the economy and use the most effective set of policy instruments. For instance, reserve requirements could be subject to leakages through direct crossborder credit to the private sector especially in financially open economies, and so capital tools, LTV and DTI could be better suited. On the other hand, in economies with an active set of foreign bank branches, capital requirements could be easily circumvented, and so RRs could be better suited if these can be applied to at least broad money liabilities for foreign branches. Similarly, LTV and DTI tools could be applied across banks and nonbanks to plug leakages through nonbanks (Section IV), since they are focused on activities, not specific types of institutions.
62. A very basic recipe is provided in the paper. Policymakers are encouraged to add flavors that are country-specific and garnishes that reflect their preferences.

 Box 1. Nonbank Lenders in the United States: Possibilities for Underestimating Systemic Risk
There is a significant presence of nonbank lenders in the United States. The FSB estimates a growing contribution of shadow banks in the US financial sector assets, especially during 2005-2007, the run up to the 2008-2009 financial crisis (figure below, left). Shadow banks include nonbank lenders of consumer and mortgage credit to households that fall outside the regulatory regimes for commercial banks.

Credit aggregates used for the analysis of systemic risk should be inclusive of these nonbank lenders.
Data (figure above, right) shows that the growth in consumer credit from all sources far outpaced the growth in commercial bank credit before the advent of both the episodes of systemic banking crises in the US—1988 and 2008 (Laeven and Valencia, 2010). Moreover, credit from commercial banks could have been underestimated due to loans sold to the Government Sponsored Enterprises (conforming mortgages) and to investment banks (nonconforming mortgages). These loans, however, are captured in the flow of funds data used to estimate consumer (including mortgage) credit growth in the United States.
Crisis signals are underestimated if credit aggregates are not inclusive of all lenders. When policy makers rely on credit aggregates for a crisis signal (see Section II), credit growth from commercial banks alone do not breach either of the two thresholds used here—GFSR and Boom (Annex 2). However, the broader credit measure would breach the GFSR threshold in the period 2001-2006. Moreover, the panel logit model (Annex 5) delivers vastly different (fitted) probabilities for the two sources of credit (figure below).

 Box 2. Effects of Macroprudential Policies on Lending Rates: What to Expect
The effects on lending rates of macroprudential policies can be determined using a loan pricing equation. Any lending decision can be reduced to a pricing equation to determine whether a loan provides sufficient return:
rL*(1-t) &gt;= E*re+(D*rd+C+A-O)*(1-t),
where:
rL = effective interest rate on the loan, including the annualized effect of fees;
t = marginal tax rate for the bank;
E = proportion of equity backing the loan;
re = required rate of return on the marginal equity;
D = proportion of debt and deposits funding the loan, assumed to be the amount of the loan minus E;
rd = effective marginal interest rate on D, including indirect costs of raising funds, such as from running a branch network;
C = the credit spread, equal to the probability-weighted expected loss;
A = administrative and other expenses related to the loan;
O = other income and expense items related to the loan.
In simple terms, the rate on the loan needs to cover the cost of capital and other funding sources, any expected credit losses, and administrative expenses. Similar to other regulatory reforms, macroprudential policies also affect the cost of capital, other funding, and lending rates by changing the proportion of debt and equity funding a loan. However, they may also trigger offsetting adjustments to one or more variables in the loan pricing equation that reduce the impact of macroprudential policies on lending rates. In the case of a full offset where return on capital is lower as predicted by the Modigliani-Miller proposition, countercyclical capital would have no effect on lending rates. Given the empirical evidence in the next section that macroprudential policies have an effect on reducing systemic risk in the short run and that offsetting effects in the loan pricing equation may be of a long-term nature, this paper assumes that macroprudential policies have a full impact on lending rates in the short term.
The simple loan pricing equation above is an important building block in most studies described earlier, as it allows researchers to translate costs arising from regulatory reforms into loan rate increases and GDP changes.2 Among others, Elliott (2009 and 2010a), BCBS (2010a, 2010b), Slovik and Cournede (2011), and IIF (2011) use variations of this loan pricing equation (also named accounting-based approach) as it is flexible enough to capture many different attributes of credit provision. Individual country studies that build on the pricing equation above include Koop et al. (2010), Schanz et al. (2011), de-Ramon et al. (2012), for instance. The loan pricing equation is especially useful in economic and econometric models with no explicit behavior for bank capital or liquidity. The pricing equation above is also useful to analyze the interaction between capital and liquidity standards and macroprudential policies. Table 2 in the text summarizes the main effects of macroprudential policies on credit and lending rates.

 Box 3. Leakages through Direct Crossborder Lending: The Croatian Experience
Croatian experience with macroprudential measures over the years 2003–2008 shows how leakages make macroprudential policy less effective. The measures introduced by the authorities aimed at slowing credit growth (the credit growth cap, the marginal reserve requirement), reducing capital inflows (the marginal reserve requirement), improving bank capitalization (higher risk weight), and bolstering bank liquidity (the foreign currency liquidity requirement).1 However, most measures were accompanied by some sort of a leakage:
 The 2003 credit growth caps: banks cut back on holdings of securities and on unused lines of credit (both items were included in the credit aggregate) and used this to offset higher growth in other categories; banks with affiliated leasing companies encouraged clients to take leases rather than loans; banks with parent banks abroad referred clients to the parent bank, with all of the screening and paperwork carried out in Croatia, but the final contracts and funding, at least formally, coming from the headquarters outside of Croatia.2
 The 2007 version of the credit growth cap: the policy closed the line of credit loophole by limiting on- and off-balance sheet items separately and dealt with the leasing problems by capturing funding of the leasing company within the credit limit. However the issue of direct parent bank lending to clients was not resolved.
 The marginal reserve requirement: banks attempted to fund its expansion plans by issuing bonds on the domestic market. As a response, the central bank implemented a 55 percent reserve requirement on funds raised by bond offerings.
 The foreign currency liquidity requirement: banks tried to evade the requirement by offering local currency deposits indexed to an exchange rate. The central bank altered its rules to include FX indexed deposits, which display the same currency risk as foreign exchange deposits, in calculation of the requirement.
Prepared by Ivo Krznar.
1 See Appendix 3 and 4 in Galac (2010) for a full description of the measures and dates of their implementation. 2 Galac (2010) finds that the credit growth cap did slow domestic lending by Croatian banks, but that this seems to have been offset by leasing and foreign borrowing, so that the measure’s effect on total private sector debt turned out to be insignificant.

 Box 4. Leakages through Foreign Branches: Empirical Evidence from the UK
A unique UK database permits an evaluation of the effectiveness of macroprudential policies, showing how leakages can occur through foreign branches. Recent empirical evidence based on the database suggests that such “leakages” are substantial but fall short of a full offset.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) imposed time-varying minimum capital requirements—so called “trigger ratios”—at the level of individual banks. These trigger ratios were set for all banks under the FSA’s jurisdiction, i.e. all UK-owned banks and resident subsidiaries of foreign banks. The discretionary regime was intended to fill gaps in the early Basel I regime, which simply imposed a uniform minimum capital requirement of 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. Trigger ratios for each bank were reviewed every 18-36 months, and changes made if deemed necessary (incorporating judgments about, among other things, evolving market conditions as well as the quality of risk management and banks’ systems and controls). Importantly trigger ratios were not imposed on an important class of UK-resident banks: branches of foreign banks, which were subject to home rather than host country regulation.
Aiyar, Calomiris and Wieladek (2012) exploit a unique UK database to explore macroprudential leakages. The study collects quarterly data on these regulatory minimum capital requirements from the FSA, and merges it with loan data reported by individual banks to the Bank of England. The institutional set-up allows the study to ask two questions, both of which are central to the effectiveness of macroprudential policies: (i) do changes in minimum capital requirements affect loan supply by regulated banks; and (ii) is the loan supply response by regulated banks offset, partially or in full, by an opposing supply response by unregulated entities (in this case, foreign branches)?
The authors find, first, that loan supply by regulated banks responds strongly to changes in minimum capital requirements. Changes in individual bank lending to the real economy are regressed on several lags of changes in the trigger ratio. Control variables include GDP growth and a number of bank-specific balance sheet characteristics. Data on bank-specific sectoral lending patterns are used to control for demand shocks, as in Aiyar (2011). A rise in the trigger ratio of 100 basis points is estimated to induce a cumulative reduction in the growth rate of bank lending of between 6 and 8 percentage points.
Second, the study finds a robust offsetting response by domestically-unregulated foreign branches.
Changes in lending by a foreign branch are regressed on several lags of the change in lending by a reference group of regulated banks. For each foreign branch, the reference group of regulated banks comprises banks that specialize in lending to the same sectors of the economy as the branch; thus the reference group captures the relevant set of competitor banks. The average branch increases lending by about 2-3 percent in response to a regulation-induced decline in lending by its reference group of 1 percent.
A UK economy-wide assessment of leakages needs to take into account that (i) foreign branches outnumber regulated banks; and (ii) the average foreign branch is much smaller than the average regulated bank. Accounting for these factors yields an estimate of aggregate leakages of about 30 percent. The fact that the offset is only partial implies that, on balance, changes in capital requirements can induce a substantial impact on aggregate credit supply. But the results also affirm the importance of cross-country cooperation on macroprudential policies, such as the reciprocity principle enshrined in the Basel III counter- cyclical capital buffer.

 Box 4. Leakages through Foreign Branches: Empirical Evidence from the UK (continued)
The estimate of leakages provided by the paper may be considered a lower bound, given that only one possible source of substitute credit—lending by unregulated foreign branches—is examined. But the authors argue that, in fact, this is likely to be the most potent channel of leakages. The theoretical and empirical finance literature suggests that securities offerings are not perfect substitutes for loans from intermediaries. Loans involve much more detailed contracting terms than bonds, and require monitoring and enforcement after the loan is made. Furthermore, the importance of “soft” information for limiting the screening, monitoring and enforcement costs of bank lending implies that there are limits to the ability of offshore lending to substitute for local intermediation (e.g., Aggarwal and Hauswald (2010)).

_ Any benefit will be realized in the long term while costs are likely to be felt immediately. _ Financial crises originate outside financial system itself. Regulation may not affect
the likelihood of crises or the overall cost of crises by any significant extent.
_ The challenge is to determine how much regulatory reform can contribute to financial stability relative to other key changes (e.g. monetary, fiscal and exchange rate framework). _ Banking crises associated with other key causes will not be made avoidable by more
stringent regulation.
_ Sign and size of impact of regulation on depth of a crisisis is uncertain.

Annex 2. Signals Based on Two Different Thresholds for Bank Credit Aggregates28, 29
International experience shows that credit growth can be a powerful predictor of financial crises so monitoring “excessive” credit growth should be the starting point for assessing the build-up of systemic risks. Credit aggregates could guide policy, especially to inform a tightening of policy by using appropriate thresholds. Two studies that examine thresholds are IMF (2011b) in the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) and Dell’Ariccia et al (2012). Comparing the GFSR threshold (3-5 percentage point annual change in the credit-GDP ratio) with the Dell’Ariccia et al threshold for defining credit booms (henceforth, Boom) shows that the GFSR threshold is triggered much more often than Boom. Relatedly, the GFSR threshold flashes (signaling a crisis coming within two years) earlier than the Boom in most cases.
Table A2.1 allows for a visual comparison of these two methodologies to flag risks. Green and yellow cells show periods in which only one of the methodologies flags risks (green for GFSR, yellow for Dell’Ariccia and others). Red cells indicate periods in which both methodologies flag risks. The table is only shown for one decade. The high preponderance of green cells shows that the GFSR methodology flags risks more often. Moreover, if the Dell’Ariccia and others methodology is flagging risks, it is likely that the GFSR is flagging risks too, but not vice versa.

Annex 3. An Output-Credit Forecasting Model30
An empirical model is set up to produce medium-term forecasts for output conditional upon an index of systemic financial stress (SFS). The SFS is the fraction of banks that have negative equity returns (vis-à-vis market returns) below the 5th percentile of returns given by the joint distribution of all banks, with cumulatively negative returns for the following two weeks (see Arsov et al, 2013).
The methodology combines two approaches: (i) local linear projection method (Jorda, 2005), also known as direct forecasts, to make the results more robust against the risk of misspecification, which is especially severe in models with episodes of large financial distress, and (ii) smooth-transition technique (Weise, 1999) to describe how the transmission between real economic activity (real GDP) and macro-financial developments (credit-to- GDP) change when the economy switches from normal times to distress.
For each forecast horizon, h = 1, ..., H, (in our analysis, H = 6 quarters) we estimate a simple linear autoregressive model explaining the t+h values of the endogenous vector
(the log of the level of real GDP, and the gap in the log of the credit-to-GDP ratio, respectively) by its own time t and lagged values and exogenous shocks, where the regression coefficient can change depending on an observed state variables (here, the index of bank distress):
where is a polynomial in the lag operator capturing the effect of the current dates and lags of the endogenous variables on their h step ahead forecasts as a non- linear function of the level of financial stress in the system. The function is a monotonically increasing sigmoid curve mapping the stress indicator, , into a range of values between 0 (no or very low stress) and 1 (very high stress):
From the point of view of our analysis, the function has two notable features. First, it is relatively flat in the region of low values of (which are observed most of the time); this way, we effectively smooth out irregular empirical fluctuations in that have almost no indicative value about the changes in the financial stress. Second, after a certain threshold (determined by the two parameters and ), the function picks up in a non-linear way meaning that the transmission characteristics from the current and lagged values of output

and credit into their forecasts may change abruptly provided the data supports the hypothesis (otherwise the estimates of the coefficients in the polynomial matrix will remain insignificant and close to zero).
The sigmoid function effectively separates the observed values of financial stress into two pools: normal times (no or very low stress), where the forecast functions can be approximated very well by a linear model, and times of high distress, where the forecast functions become non-linear.
The model is non-recursive: for each forecast horizon, a separate equation must be estimated: the forecasts cannot be iterated mechanically forward as is the case e.g. with VAR models. This fact makes the techniques extremely flexible and suitable for forecasting, but it is much less convenient for policy simulation experiments.
The design of the experiment we present in the main text is as follows. We select a sub- period of time (here, 2002:1 through 2012:2), and calculate the forecasts for each horizon, , as implied by the estimated model using the actually observed data, , on the
right-hand side of the equations,
Then, we create a new vector of artificial observations by increasing the level of credit-to- GDP ratio on the RHS by 1 percent in each period. Denoting the new vector of observations by , we re-calculate the forecasts, ,
and report the differences, .
Note that the impact of an increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio on the forecasts varies, in general, with the position of the economy in the financial cycle, through the function and the estimated coefficients in .
The main result: The role of credit for the GDP forecast changes depending on the state of the banking sector. A 1 percent increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio in normal times amount to improvements in the GDP forecasts by about 0.2 percent on a 4-6 quarter-ahead horizon, whereas the same increase will reduce the GDP forecast by about 1 percent (on the same forecast horizon) in times of large distress.
The estimates of the regression coefficients are depicted in Figure A3.1. For each forecast horizon (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 quarters ahead) we plot the regression coefficients as a function of the distress index (for values between 0 percent and 25 percent, which is approximately the range observed in the actual data). The first row is the GDP equation, the second row is the credit-to-GDP gap equation. The first column is the sum of coefficients on the current

and lagged GDP terms, the second column is the sum of coefficients on the current and lagged credit-to-GDP terms.

Annex 4. Estimating the effect of intermediate targets on the cost of a financial crises: Methodology31
Identifying a financial crisis
We adopt the Laeven and Valencia (2010) definition under which a banking crisis is systemic if two conditions are present: (i) significant signs of distress in the banking system (as indicated by significant bank runs, losses in the banking system, and bank liquidations); and (ii) significant banking policy interventions in response to significant losses in the banking system. See Laeven and Valencia (2010) for more details. The database covers 109 countries32 (emerging and developed), annually, from 1970 until 2010.
Measuring the cost of a financial crisis
For the purpose of the analysis in this note, we focus on GDP loss measures and ignore other costs of financial crises (e.g. fiscal costs). We measure the cost of a financial crisis as follows:
1) For each of the 5 years following the start of the crisis, compute the percentage difference from potential output (computed using the five year pre-crisis average growth rate).
2) If output exceeds potential the difference is set at zero.
3) The cost of crisis is the average over all 5 years.
The cost measure used here is therefore an average yearly cost relative to potential. For 17 percent of the countries in the sample, a financial crisis was not associated with any output cost. Around a third of the countries in the sample have recovered above the potential pre- crisis level of output by the end of the five year window. The average yearly cost of a financial crisis is estimated at 7.3 percent of potential output. The maximum average yearly cost is 34 percent and corresponds to Latvia 2008.

32 The database additionally covers Congo, Eritrea, Macedonia, Santo Tome and Tanzania which are excluded from our crisis database inherited from GFSR September 2011.
  
54
Comparison to other methodologies
There is a vast literature on how to measure the costs of a financial crisis (see BCBS 2010a and Hoggarth, Reis and Saporta 2001 for a survey). To assess our cost measure, we compare the results with five different measures of the cost of a crisis.

 It is important to note that the cost measures are not directly comparable. Our cost measure is relative to potential output, while the others are relative to pre-crisis output. Our cost measure and costs 2 and 3 are yearly differences, while costs 4 and 5 are cumulative.
33 For cost 1 to cost 5, we ignore crises started in 2008 that have not recovered by the year 2012 and we bound the crisis length at 5 years after the start.

 Even if the cost levels under the different measures are not directly comparable, it is informative to look at the correlation between the different cost measures. Our cost measure has a very high correlation with cost measures 2, 3 and 4 (which are in turn very highly correlated with each other).

Note that none of the cost measures allows for permanent effects on output of a financial crisis. Those are covered for instance in BCBS 2010a, Schanz and others 2011 and IMF 2009.
Intermediate targets and the depth of a crisis
We estimate the relationship between an intermediate target in the run-up to the crisis and the depth of the crisis. In particular, we consider the measure of credit expansion given by the change in credit to GDP ratio from t-3 to t-2 in percentage points, where t denotes the date of a crisis according to Laeven and Valencia (2010). Because by construction the cost of a financial crisis is bounded at zero, we estimate both an OLS (Table A4.3) and Tobit (Table

A4.4) specification. Because twin crisis are expected to be more costly, we introduce a dummy variable that is equal to one if there is a currency crisis at t-1, t or t+1.
The pre-crisis change in the credit to GDP ratio 2 years before a crisis has a significant positive relationship with the depth of a crisis. This is robust across cost measures and across estimation methodologies (OLS and Tobit).
Here are the results using change in credit to GDP growth from t-3 to t-2. The cost measure is cost 7. The coefficients of the OLS and Tobit regressions are not directly comparable as the coefficients in the latter are not the marginal effects. The marginal effect for our proposed cost measure is reported below. The marginal effects across both estimation methods are very close, roughly 0.6. This means that a 1 percentage point higher change in the credit to GDP ratio prior to the crisis is associated with a higher average yearly cost of a financial crisis of 0.6 percent, if the crisis were to materialize. The sample median of credit growth 2 years before a crisis is around 3 percentage points, and the average cost of crisis is 8 percent below potential for five years. A country with a 6 percentage points credit growth will have 8+0.6*3 = 9.8 percent below potential on average for five years.

denotes a binary banking crisis variable; is a row vector of explanatory is the change in credit-to-GDP ratio and RHPG is the real house price
denotes the random effect for country ; is the cumulative distribution function
We adopt the Laeven and Valencia (2010) definition under which a banking crisis is systemic if two conditions are present: (1) significant signs of distress in the banking system (as indicated by significant bank runs, losses in the banking system, and bank liquidations); and (2) significant banking policy interventions in response to significant losses in the banking system.
The basic specification includes annual growth in real house prices and the change in the ratio of credit to GDP as explanatory variables from 1970-2010. We consider both end of period (eop) and period average (avg) real house prices. In addition, we include an interaction term between a dummy for high credit growth and real house price growth. This intends to capture the idea in Borio and Drehmann (2009) that imbalances manifest themselves in the coexistence of unusually rapid growth in private sector credit and asset prices. For simplicity, the threshold to determine the high credit growth dummy is taken at 3 percentage points (IMF, 2011b). But in actual estimation, a lower threshold of 2 percentage points also had significant effect on the crossproduct, .
The change in credit-to-GDP ratio has a significant positive relationship with the crisis probability irrespective of the behavior in real house prices (Table A5.1). Real house price growth, however, show a significant effect on the probability of a banking crisis only during events of high credit growth. In line with Borio and Drehmann (2009), the interaction term captures the coexistence of asset price misalignments. The specification chosen to compute the crisis probability in the main text is given by
6,. 34 Prepared by Nicolas Arregui.
 
58
As robustness checks, a variety of alternative specifications were considered: fixed effects as opposed to random effects, a different threshold to determine the high credit growth dummy (2 percentage points) and different forecasting horizons (1 and 3 years). The coefficients on the change in credit-to-GDP and the interaction between high credit growth and real house prices growth appear to be stable under different specifications. Since the coefficient on RHPGt-2 is small and not significantly different from zero, one can choose to ignore it; dropping this term from the regression reduces the coefficient on the crossproduct but the fitted probability estimates do not change significantly (specification 3 in Table A5.1).
Figure A5.1 shows the surface for the probability of a crisis derived from this model. The 2- dimenstion version of this surface is presented in Figure 5 in the main text.

Annex 6. Effect of Macroprudential Policy Instruments on Intermediate Targets35
Recent studies suggest that macroprudential policy could be effective in mitigating systemic risk. In particular, several tools can be used to deal with credit and real estate booms.
Cross-country studies
LTVs and DTIs. Almeida, Campello, and Liu (2005) find evidence that LTV limits have an effect on the financial accelerator mechanism and that housing prices are more sensitive to income shocks in countries with higher maximum LTV ratios. Wong et al (2011) show that LTV policy has been effective in reducing systemic risk in Hong Kong and other countries in terms of reducing household leverage. Ahuja and Nabar (2011) using data on 49 emerging and advanced economies finds some evidence that LTV limits slow property price growth while both LTVs and DTIs can slow mortgage credit growth. IMF (2011d) shows that high LTV ratio strengthens the effect of real GDP growth on house price growth and that government participation, including subsidies to first time homebuyers and capital gains tax deductibility, tends to exacerbate house price swings. Kuttner and Shim (2012) find that changes in maximum LTV and/or DTI ratios have strong effect on house prices and housing credit (using data from 57 economies going back as far as 1980).
Other instruments. Lim et al (2011), based on the IMF survey data, find that several macroprudential tools, including caps on the loan-to-value ratio, caps on the debt-to-income ratio, ceilings on credit or credit growth, reserve requirements, countercyclical capital requirements and time-varying/dynamic provisioning, can reduce credit growth procyclicality. Dell’Ariccia et al (2012) show that macroprudential policy, measured as a composite measure of six instruments, can reduce the incidence of credit booms and decrease the probability that booms end up badly. The existing research also suggests that various macroprudential tools can be used to deal with credit and real estate booms (mostly focusing on LTV caps). Vandenbussche, Vogel, and Detragiache (2012) find that changes in the capital requirement and liquidity measures had an impact on housing price inflation in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Tovar et al (2012) show that an the average reserve requirement and a composite of other types of macroprudential instruments (dynamic provisioning, capital requirement etc.) have a moderate and transitory effect on credit growth in five Latin American countries.
Country studies
LTVs and DTIs. Ahuja and Nabar (2011) find that tightening LTV limits in Hong Kong reduced both transaction volumes and price growth, albeit with a lag. Moreover, Craig and Hua (2011) find that LTVs and stamp duties on property transactions helped slow down property price inflation in Hong Kong. Igan and Kang (2011) find that LTV and DTI limits seem to be associated with a decline in house price appreciation and transaction activity in

61
Korea. Krznar and Medas (2012) find that the last four measures to tighten macroprudential instruments (LTVs in particular) were associated with lower mortgage credit and house price growth in Canada.
Other instruments. Galac (2010) finds that credit growth ceiling introduced in Croatia in 2003 and 2007 reduced domestic private but not total private sector credit growth (as domestic corporate debt was substituted with foreign debt). Jimenez et al (2012) shows that dynamic provisioning introduced in Spain in 2000 mitigated credit supply cycles and had positive aggregate and firm-level credit availability and real effects. Wang and Sun (2013) find that changes in reserve requirement were effective in curbing the credit growth and house price growth in China.
Our approach
We add to the existing literature by using cross-country data to estimate the quantitative impact of macroprudential tools in cooling down the housing market (specifically house prices) and credit growth. We estimate dynamic panel regressions model for the five most frequently used policy instruments, to assess whether a tightening (loosening) of macroprudential instruments has an impact on many systemic risk measures: credit, credit/GDP, house prices, liquidity, leverage, capital flows. The sample is based on data from 38 countries, for the 2000-2011 period, which have used different instruments (LTVs, DTIs, risk weights, reserve requirements and provisioning requirements) to contain systemic risks. The regressions use a step function variable for each macroprudential instrument. This variable changes by one every time the instrument is tightened and does not change until the subsequent change of the instrument. To control for the business cycle and the price of mortgage lending we include GDP growth and long term lending rate as independent variables.
While the results suggest that LTVs, DTIs, reserve requirements and risk weights can be effective in containing credit and house prices growth (Tables A.6.1-A.6.4.), there is some evidence that reserve and provisioning requirement are associated with some “leakages” (Table A.6.5). The panel regressions provide evidence that tightening LTVs, DTIs, reserve requirements and risk weights lead to a reduction in credit/GDP and house prices growth while provisioning does not seem to have a significant impact. The control variables, interest rates and GDP growth, have the expected signs in almost all specifications of the model.

A step function variable is used for all MaPP instruments (takes +1 at the time the instrument is tightened). Instrumental variables for the policy instrument (lags) and the (one-step) GMM Arellano-Bond estimator are used
to address selection bias and endogeneity.
Dependent variable:
  Capital flows variable is the ratio of foreign liabilities to foreign assets, for bank institutions (source: IFS)
 Independent variables:
The lending rate is the average interest rate on the short-and medium-term financing needs of the private sector (source: IFS) GDP growth is defined as y-o-y growth rate of real GDP (source: IFS))

            <Text>Motivation
- paper suggest simple framework to compare cost with benefits of macroprudential policy
- benefits are normally defines as a reduction in expected crisis costs
- macroprudential policies are needed to dampen the effect of three externalities
- if systemic risk is correctly identified and policy is successful in avoiding or reducing the affect if a crisis, systemic risk is lowered
- cross-country empirical evidence is essential to this analysis
An Analytical Recipe: The Ingredients
- policy instruments seek to target certain market failures or externalities
- externalities are hard to observe —&gt; some indicators could help detect their presence
- e.g. rapid credit growth during boom times be the result of “strategic complementarities that lead banks to take excessive or correlated risks and build up vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of the financial cycle (externality related to strategic compliments)
 —&gt; therefore policy would be effective if it could bring down the speed of credit growth
- indicators of funding-liquidity risk and market-liquidity risk could be used as intermediate targets for externalities related to fire sales - a generalised sell-off of financial assets causing a decline in asset prices 
- policy intruments that are able to lower a liquidity risk indicator would succeed in lowering the risk of fire sales (externality related to fire sales and credit crunches)
- early warning indicators are imperfect at measuring the risk of a financial crisis 
- previous studies have shown that rapid credit growth and credit booms signal a banking crisis 2-3 years before the event 
- out of sample analysis show that credit growth produced very low probabilities of crisis before 2007
- therefore policy makers need to compare the possible benefits of avoiding a crisis with the cost of tightening up the activity now
- they need to consider the imperfect nature if the signal and the possibility of over-regulating
- credit aggregates aggregates are useful to guide policy, especially to inform tightening of policy by using appropriate thresholds
- something about the GFSR threshold
Policy Time Line
-Determine whether:
Credit growth excessive
Credit boom identifies
Liquidity risks are high
-Policy measures
Reserve Requirements 
Capital Requirements 
Provisioning 
Loan-to-Value limits
Debt-to-Income limits
- this influences (intermediate target
Real Credit
Real House Price
Loan-Deposit Ratio
Foreign Liabilities/ Foreign Assets
-To avoid underestimating risks, policy makers should include credit from all type of lenders not just commercial banks 
- in reality policymakers are more likely to look at several indicate to gauge building up of systemic risk
Conceptual Framework for assessing net benefits of policy
- having decided on when to act policymakers need to asses the net benefit of any policy action on the long-term level of GDP
- macroprudential policy that affects an intermediate target, like credit growth has both costs and benefits
- policy is expected to bring down the probability of crisis from p to p* and the loss from l to l*
- it may not eliminate crisis fully but build a resilience for the financial sector
- if the porbability of the crisis was largely overestimated then policy is costly by bringing down the level of intermediation and the forecast for the output that would have been without a crisis
- if there is no crisis output will be lower than Y* by a factor a because of the dampening of activity from harnessing rapid credit growth 
- the no-policy expected output is at E (taking into account the probability and depth of crisis) and the forecast with policy is B if the probability and depth of crisis are both reduces 
 -Therefore BE is the benefit from policy 
Simple analytical way 
- comparing the forecast for the output Lebel 2 years from t with and without policy
- expected output if there is nor crisis Yt+2
- crisis occurs at t+2 with a probability of p, which depends on the levels of the early warning indicators 
- if crisis occurs the output forecast drops by l, which can also depend on the intermediate targets
- (1-pl)Yt+2
- when policy is introduced both p and l can be lower, at the same time by lowering intermediation levels (for instance credit growth) the output forecast is also lower by the same factor alpha - this factor depends upon the sensitivity of output to the intermediate targets 
- (1-p)(1-a)Yt+2
- for policy to pay off the x ante net benefit should be positive
- (1-pl)(1-a)&gt;=(1-pl)
- the simple setup does not take account two unseen costs - imperfections of the early warning indicators and policy leakages 
- could be included by adding noise-to-signal ratios (NSR) - the possibility that the signal is false or that the crisis 
- it is difficult to know how to assign NRS
- the actual practical implication of this framework will be much more complex, because the interactions between output, risk and policy will be dynamic
- binary variable for crisis no crisis would be replaces in a realistic model with a time varying multivariate probability distribution
A few insights from the simple expression
- net benefits do not kick in when the probability of a crisis is very low
- net benefits are extremely sensitive to how intermediate targets affects the output forecast, the sensitivity is given by alpha
- net benefits will rise with policy effectiveness, policies that lower both the probability and the depth of a crisis that is both p* and l* have significant higher net benefits
Building blocks that are required to compare cost to benefits 
- early warning system that alerts policymakers 2-3 years ahead of the crisis
- sensitivity of forward-looking measure of output Yt+2 to intermediate targets alpha 
- an estimate of the probability of crisis p, and the loss in level of output in the event of a crisis l 
- the effectivness of policy instruments on dampening growth in intermediate targets and the effect of a reduction in intermediate targets 
Analytical building blocks
No Policy Expected output
- to examine costs and benefits of macroprudential policies, policymakers have to start from a baseline forecast for output and the intermediate target
- a method is needed for estimating the real-time forecast of activity
- the probability  and the cost of a crisis need ti be computed 
- then forecast activity need to be adjusted for the risk of a crisis
- a buildup in the financial sector risk affects the forecast of GDP and this effect changes with the state of the banking sector 
- early warning indicators are used to estimate the probability of a financial crisis 
- IMF (2011b) and Lund-Jensen (2012) used a panel logit model to estimate a crisis-probability 2-years ahead using credit growth and asset price growth 
- the probability of a crisis can be located on a “heat map” for various combinations of credit and house price growth 
- experience from various countries show that GDP loss during crisis can be substantial 
- the output loss during the crisis is greater the higher the systemic risk prior to the crisis 
- there are several steps involved in deriving the non policy expected output (Figures 7)
Effectiveness of macroprudentail policies 
Policy response
- different policy instruments affect intermediate targets and build resilience in different ways 
- tools can be classified according to the portion of financial institutions balance sheets they effect directly 
Capital based tools
- risk weights have typically been in erased on assets such as mortgage loans fearing property price booms, loans to other overheating sectors, or foreign currency loans currency loans to unhedged borrowers
- the negative effect of risk-weighted assets (RWA) could be through higher lending rates 
-countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) could have similar effects except that these buffers may not be as well targeted as the RWA
Reserve Requirements (RR)
- countries use RR on various funding instruments to build liquidity buffer against risky sources of funds
- since it restricts the funding available to back new loans and requires setting aside assets as reserve, there is less to lend and could have a direct effect on credit growth and loan/deposit ratio
- the increase could also lead to higher lending rates
Loan -to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income (DTV) requirements
- both impact the loan of new tools by tightening eligibility criteria and are quantitive tools that could limit mortgage credit growth and house price growth 
- LTV and DTI imply that new borrowers who are not eligible are excluded from loan markets and eligible ones havee to borrow less
- this is a reduction in the flow of credit 
-Lower expected and unexpected loss 
- no negative quantitive impact on credit growth and house prices 
Dynamic provisioning 
- discourages credit growth with a pricing effect on lending rates 
- tend to set a buffer against fluctuations 
- could lead to an increase in the cost of capital and lending rates
- table 2 zeigt was alles effected wird
Empirical Evidence 
- actual experience with macroprudentail policy show that policy can be effective on intermediate targets 
- the results show that certain policies could successfully bring down indicators related to two externalities 
Certain policies could successfully bring down indicators related to two externalities
-Ltv, rr and risk weights effect credit growth and house price growth (strategic complementaries)
- DTI slows down loan/deposit growth and the share of foreign liabilities in foreign asset growth (fire sales and credit crunches) 
- rr foe lowering loan-deposit ratio
-risk weights and ltv effect asset-liabilities
- the policy also have prolonged impacts 
- correlated-risk taking externalities: higher capital requirements, on average, have historically lowered credit growth by about 1 percent on impact and by 5 percent point in short term and by 6 in two years	
- during the upswing both capital and reserve requirements can build buffers but the quality of this buffer matters 
- this is especially true for capital requirements
- need to raise quality of loss absorbing buffer 
- table 3 zeigt auf was die das alles regressiert haben
- tighter policy affects intermediate targets that in turn lower the probability and depth of output loss in case of crisis 
- policy costs depend upon the sensitivity of the output forecast to intermediate targets had there been no crisis
- if risks were mis-measured and crisis risks were actually zero, then the tightening policy lowers the GDP forecast level (compare this to no-crisis no-policy level) 
- summarising the various ingredients can now be mixed together to get the net benefit of policy
- figure 10 summary of measurements
- macroprudential policy could have unintended side-effects beside the intended costs and benefits through leakages 
- where incentives for risk-taking still exists they will attempt to make use of it 
-  also there could be other unintended consequences of macroprudential policies 
- shadow banking sector make it difficult to identify systemic risk 
- viel über leakages (RR hat leakages)
- therefore the finding suggest that in financially open economics capital requirements and LTV tools could better be suited ti limit buildup in credit-related risks than reserve requirements
Summary and Policy implications
- the work remains under construction 
- there remains work to be done on the core analytical model that blends together all the components
- while the structure of the model is clear its estimation remains complicated and subject to robustness test 
- most important are the performance of early warning models 
-policymakers need proper measures of the intermediate target: not just bank credit but all sources of credit
- net benefits do not kick in when the probability of crisis is so low that even fully effective policies that even fully effective policies do not make a significant difference between pre- and post-policy probabilities of a crisis 
- net benefits are very sensitive to how intermediate targets affect the output forecast
- if macro-financial linkages are Hugh, output is highly sensitive tointermediation; in such cases policy mistakes, especially when policy over reacts to signals (“false positives”) could be very costly 
- net benefits rise with policy effectiveness as long as the costs are contained; for benefits to be high the difference between pre- and post policy probabilities of crisis (p and p*) and the pre and post policy loss (l and l*) needs to be large 
- the measures that are most effective and have prolonged effects on credit growth and house price growth are rr, higher risk weights on capital and LTV limits 
- evidence of leakages or unintended consequences of some policies

Abstract
Digging Deeper—Evidence on the Effects of Macroprudential Policies from a New Database
Prepared by Zohair Alam, Adrian Alter, Jesse Eiseman, Gaston Gelos, Heedon Kang, Machiko Narita, Erlend Nier, and Naixi Wang1
 IMF Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to encourage debate. The views expressed in IMF Working Papers are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF, its Executive Board, or IMF management.
     This paper introduces a new comprehensive database of macroprudential policies, which combines information from various sources and covers 134 countries from January 1990 to December 2016. Using these data, we first confirm that loan-targeted instruments have a significant impact on household credit, and a milder, dampening effect on consumption. Next, we exploit novel numerical information on loan-to-value (LTV) limits using a propensity- score-based method to address endogeneity concerns. The results point to economically significant and nonlinear effects, with a declining impact for larger tightening measures. Moreover, the initial LTV level appears to matter; when LTV limits are already tight, the effects of additional tightening on credit is dampened while those on consumption are strengthened.

I. INTRODUCTION
Despite considerable progress over the past years in assessing the effectiveness of macroprudential policies, many questions remain unanswered.2 In particular, the literature has so far not fully succeeded in rigorously quantifying the effects of various macroprudential measures. This is due in part to a reliance on incomplete datasets in terms of the coverage of countries and measures. Moreover, previous research has mostly used dummy-type policy action indices, which do not allow for an estimation of quantitative effects of policies, a key issue for policymakers. In addition, endogeneity problems often hamper a proper assessment of macroprudential effects: macroprudential measures are usually taken in response to developments in credit and asset prices. If not properly addressed econometrically, this will tend to result in biased estimates (typically understating the effectiveness of macroprudential measures).3
In this paper, we aim to address some of these shortcomings by making progress on four fronts. First, we construct a new comprehensive database of macroprudential policies, combining information from various sources. Second, making use of the unique features of this database, we quantify the impact of a one-percentage-point change in LTV limits on household credit and house prices. Third, we address the endogeneity problem using propensity-score based methods to identify causal effects. Fourth, we make progress toward assessing side effects of macroprudential policies, by investigating their impact on private consumption. Assessing the effects on consumption is a first step toward a more comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits, which is outside of the scope of this paper.4
Our new database, the integrated Macroprudential Policy (iMaPP) database, has three advantages over other databases. First, it provides a comprehensive coverage in terms of instruments, countries, and time periods. It combines information from five existing databases, as well as the IMF’s new Annual Macroprudential Policy Survey, and various additional sources, such as authorities’ official announcements and IMF country documents. Second, the iMaPP database provides the average LTV limit prevailing in a given country at any given point in time, while most other databases only provide dummy-type policy action

3 Studies trying to address this problem include Richter and others (2018), as well as some studies using micro data, such as Basten and Koch (2015) and Epure and others (2018).

indicators.5 Third, the iMaPP database will be updated annually using information from the IMF’s annual survey.6
Using the iMaPP database, we first broadly confirm results from the literature using standard methods and dummy-type indicators. In this analysis, we use panel regressions with data for 34 advanced and 29 emerging market economies for the period 1990 Q1–2016 Q4, and rely on a simple timing assumption to address endogeneity, as is common in the literature. Our results are in line with those in earlier studies: we find significant impacts of loan-targeted instruments on real credit to households, while the effects on house prices are weaker.7 In addition, we document a mild dampening effect on real household consumption.
Next, we exploit the new feature of our database—namely numerical information on the calibration of LTV limits—to quantify more precisely the impact of changes in these limits. To better identify the causal effects of LTV changes, we use a propensity-score-based method, which penalizes observations that are likely affected by reverse causality. Rich numerical information of the LTV limits also allow us to investigate nonlinear effects.
We find strong and nonlinear effects of LTV changes on household credit, and modest side effects on consumption. For the most common magnitude of LTV action in our sample—a tightening of less than 10 percentage points (ppts)—a one-ppt LTV tightening cumulatively reduces household credit growth by about 0.7 ppts after four quarters. For larger actions—a tightening by more than 10 ppts and less than 25 ppts—, the cumulative decline in household credit growth per one-ppt tightening is found to be smaller at 0.4 ppts. The side effects on consumption are less significant and of lesser magnitude, at around 0.1 ppts in both cases. The smaller per-unit effects on household credit of a larger LTV tightening could be driven by policy leakages, because a strong tightening could incentivize credit from abroad or from nonbank lenders, to which LTV limits may not apply.
We also find that the initial LTV level appears to matter for the tradeoff: when LTV limits are already tight, the effects on credit are milder, but the side effects on consumption stronger. This suggests that countries with tight LTV limits might be better off considering other macroprudential tools to complement existing measures.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II compares features of the iMaPP database to other similar databases and explains the construction of the average LTV limit
5 See Appendix I Table 4. Although a few databases provide intensity-adjusted policy action indicators (Vandenbussche and others 2015 and Richter and others 2018), they do not provide the level information of the LTV limits, which the iMaPP database does.
6 For a description of this survey see IMF (2018a).
7 Many empirical studies provide the estimated effects per policy action, typically on credit growth and house prices (e.g., Igan and Kang 2011, Elliott and others 2013, Krznar and Morsink 2014, Kuttner and Shim 2016, Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey 2018, Cerutti and others 2017, IMF 2017, and Poghosyan 2018).

data. Section III revisits the standard regression analysis from the literature. Section IV quantifies the effects and the side-effects of a one ppt change in the LTV limits. Section V concludes.
II. INTEGRATED MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY DATABASE A. Key Features of the Database
Our new macroprudential policy database integrates information from five major existing databases, and enriches this further with information from the IMF’s new Annual Macroprudential Policy Survey, authorities’ official announcements, and additional information from the BIS, FSB, and IMF. 8 The integrated Macroprudential Policy Database (iMaPP) database provides (1) dummy-type indices of tightening and loosening actions for 17 macroprudential policy instruments and their subcategories; (2) detailed description of each policy action; and (3) country-level averages of the regulatory limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at a monthly frequency. The database will be updated annually with information from the IMF’s Annual Macroprudential Survey.
Whereas most existing databases focus on selected areas, the iMaPP database provides a comprehensive picture of macroprudential policy. 9 10 It covers all instruments discussed in IMF (2014a,b), classifying them into 17 categories, for 134 countries from January 1990 to December 2016. It includes policy instruments that can be macroprudential in nature but also serve other purposes (such as capital flow management- and monetary policy measures), noting that macroprudential policy instruments can overlap with other policies (IMF 2014a, 2017). For reserve requirements, which are generally difficult to attribute unambiguously to macroprudential or monetary policy, the iMaPP database also provides a subcategory of differentiated reserve requirements by currency. See Appendix I Table 3 for the exact categories and their descriptions.
In addition to its wide coverage of instruments, countries, and time periods, the iMaPP database presents two distinct features: a granular breakdown of policy action indices by instruments, and the average LTV limit data. These features are discussed in more detail below.
However, there are also a few caveats. First, the iMaPP database does not cover every initial implementation, especially if instruments were introduced before the sample period starts.
8 The integrated databases are Lim and others (2011, 2013), the Global Macroprudential Policy Instrument (GMPI) survey conducted by the IMF in 2013, Shim and others (2013), and the database by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). See Appendix I for more information.
9 Our definition of macroprudential policy is the use of primarily prudential tools to limit systemic risk, following IMF (2013a, 2013b, 2014a, 2014b), and IMF-FSB-BIS (2016).
10 See Appendix I Table 4 for a comparison of the coverages in existing databases and in the iMaPP database.

Second, the database only includes policy actions that have been verified through cross- checking with official documents. In some cases, data availability was constrained by language barriers and reporting differences.
B. Granular Policy Action Indices
Similarly to many existing databases (Appendix I Table 4), the iMaPP database provides dummy-type tightening and loosening indices. The dummy-type policy action indices take the value of 1 for tightening actions, -1 for loosening actions, and zero for no change. These indices are provided for 17 instruments at a monthly frequency. In addition, for selected instruments (e.g., capital requirements), our database provides the subcategories of general, household-sector, and corporate-sector measures to allow researchers to examine the effects of instruments that target particular sectoral exposures. These dummy indices are based on the effective date when it differs from the announcement date, because the effective date is more widely available.
The dummy-type indices are useful in several ways. First, focusing on the policy action and its direction, they extract information across diverse policies. Although calculating measures of policy intensity for all instruments would in principle be preferable, it would be difficult, and possibly not feasible, to construct such measures, given that the designs of instruments of interest are diverse. In fact, many policy instruments are implemented differently across countries, with different definitions of regulated variables, so that the numerical information provided in regulations is often not comparable across countries. Second, dummy indicators help characterize the use of macroprudential policy instruments and are useful to estimate the effects of macroprudential instruments per policy action, as in previous studies.
However, as discussed in the next subsection, these dummy-type indices only indicate the direction of a policy change, and lack information on the intensity of the change. For this reason, it is important to note that large changes in these indices do not necessarily indicate large changes in the policy instruments. It is possible, for instance, that some instruments are adjusted frequently but with small changes, while other instruments are adjusted less frequently but with large changes.
C. Average LTV Limits
We construct a quantitative measure of the regulatory limits on LTV ratios, one of the most widely used macroprudential instruments (Section II.D.). While some countries maintain such limits also for other types of loans (e.g., for car loans), we focus on those for real estate mortgage loans. Because countries tend to tailor the scope of their regulatory LTV limits to address specific vulnerabilities, they often have multiple regulatory LTV limits for different loan categories (e.g., loans for the primary residence, buy-to-let loans). To summarize the regulatory LTV limits prevailing in a given country, we take the simple average of regulatory LTV limits of all existing categories in that country, based on quantitative data contained in

7
the text information of the iMaPP database. We construct this average LTV limit for 66 countries for each month from January 2000 to December 2016 (see Appendix II).
This average LTV limit series complements existing indices by providing quantitative information on both the level and changes of LTV limits. First, while most existing policy action indices only indicate the direction of a policy change (Appendix I Table 4), our average LTV limit series also informs about the intensity of the policy change. Second, the series provides information on the level of regulatory LTV limits, while existing intensity- adjusted policy action indices do not (Vandenbussche and others 2015, and Richter and others 2018).
The average LTV limit can assist research and policy in many ways. Since the series closely tracks the prevailing limits on the LTV ratios, it allows us to quantify in greater detail the effects of changes in regulatory limits. In addition, because it contains the level information, it enables further examination of possible nonlinear effects of changes in regulatory limits (see Section IV).
One caveat is that the average LTV limit series may overstate the importance of LTV limits that only apply to a small group of loans. This is because the simple average gives equal weights to all categories, while regulatory changes affecting a large range of loans could be considered more important than those applied to a smaller range. One possible refinement could be to construct a weighted average of regulatory LTV limits, based on market shares of loan categories. However, such a weighted average requires time series of loan shares, which are not readily available in many countries.
D. How has Macroprudential Policy Been Used?
Before turning to the empirical analysis of the impact of macroprudential measures, we document how the use of such measures has grown globally over the recent past. The iMaPP database reveals that the number of economies that have used any macroprudential policy tool has been increasing steadily since 1990, before reaching a plateau around 2012. By that time, over 90 percent of economies in the sample had used at least one such tool (Figure 1). Interestingly, even before the global financial crisis, many had already implemented at least one macroprudential instrument—23 out of 36 advanced economies (AEs) and 61 out of 98 emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) as of December 2006.

Sources: The iMaPP database (see Appendix I for the original sources) and authors’ calculations. Note: The figure shows the number of economies that have used any macroprudential policy instrument (except for reserve requirements) at least once during the sample period. There are total 134 economies (36 AEs and 98 EMDEs) in the iMaPP database. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.
Turning to more recent usage, LTV limits emerge as the most popular tool among AEs, while limits on foreign exchange (FX) position are the tools most widely used among EMDEs (Figure 2). This may reflect differences in key risks—while AEs tend to be more concerned about housing sector vulnerabilities, EMDEs are more exposed to vulnerabilities from external shocks, including volatile capital flows and the potential systemic risks triggered by sharp changes in the exchange rate (Cerutti and others, 2017). On the other hand, some instruments are widely used in both AEs and EMDEs, such as capital requirements, LTV limits, and liquidity requirements.

The frequency of policy actions varies across instruments (Figure 3). Focusing on the period after 2010, when most sample economies had implemented macroprudential instruments, we find that among AEs, the number of policy actions is largest for LTV limits, at 0.17 times per year on average (i.e., one in about six years). In EMDEs, the tool exhibiting the most policy

9
actions are reserve requirements at 0.20 times per year—once in about five years. Some instruments have had very few actions in both groups, such as countercyclical buffers (CCB). Although the frequencies pertaining to individual instruments appear rather low, if we look at the policy actions across all instruments, then the frequency is much higher at 0.79 actions per year for AEs and 0.65 actions per year for EMDEs (i.e., at least one action in two years). In other words, policy makers are fairly active overall in using macroprudential policies, but the frequency varies considerably across economies (Kuttner and Shim, 2016).

Notes: For each instrument, we first take the country-level average number of adjustments, and then take the group-level average of the country-level average numbers of adjustments. The average numbers of actions are calculated for 2010M1-2016M12. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.
Macroprudential policy tends to be tightened when household credit rises (Figure 4). For example, during the early 2000s, when credit growth was high, the net number of tightening actions across macroprudential instruments rose for both AEs and EMDEs. This suggests that macroprudential authorities actively take actions in response to credit developments, and underscores the importance of the reverse causality problem for empirical analysis.
The iMaPP database also provides quantitative information on regulatory LTV limits for
66 economies, revealing that they exhibit a wide range of values. For the 36 economies with an average LTV limit of less than 100 percent as of December 2016, the median is about
75 percent, but the distribution ranges from 47 to 95 percent (Figure 5, left panel).11 In particular, average limits in EMDEs appear tighter than those in AEs (Figure 5, right panel).
11 The average LTV limit is set to 100 when no regulatory limits exist. See Appendix II.

and house price increases?12 To address these questions, the iMaPP database not only offers more recent data, but also enables a comparison of the relative effects of different instruments (e.g., demand- vs. supply- side instruments, sector specific- vs. general measures). Furthermore, we also assess side effects of these measures in terms of dampening consumption growth and the growth of GDP, thereby adding to a very small literature that has looked at these side effects previously (IMF 2012, Richter and others 2018).
Building on the specifications in Arregui and others (2013) and Kuttner and Shim (2016), we estimate the following panel regression:
𝛥𝛥4𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = ρ ∆4C𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + β MaPP𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + γ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + α𝑖𝑖 + μ𝑡𝑡 + ε𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡, (1)
where i is country and t is time (quarter).13 The dependent variable, ∆4𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡, refers to the year- on-year growth rate of real household credit, real house prices, real private consumption, and real GDP, which are winsorized at one percent to address outliers.
The main independent variable, MaPPi,t, is the policy change indicator for the instrument or the instrument group i at time t. This indicator records tightening actions (+1), loosening actions (-1), and no changes (0), and is cumulated over the past four quarters (and divided by four), to account for potential lagged effects. Since for many individual tools the variation is limited, we consider indices for instrument groups, including all, loan-targeted, demand, and supply measures, which are further subdivided into three categories, including general-, capital-, and loan-supply tools (see Appendix IV). To assess the effects of individual instruments, we focus on those with relatively more variation: loan-to-value limits (LTV), debt-service-to-income limits (DSTI), loan restrictions (LOANR), limits on bank credit growth (LCG), loan loss provisioning requirements (LLP), capital requirements (Capital), and tax measures (TAX).
The lagged dependent variable (𝛥𝛥4𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1) is included as a regressor to account for persistence. A vector 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 includes lagged macro control variables, such as real GDP growth and domestic real interest rates, as well as other macroprudential policies when regressions focus on the effect of specific measures.14 Time fixed effects (μt) capture time-
 12 In so doing, we assess the extent to which macroprudential policy is able to attain one of its intermediate objectives: to contain the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities by reducing procyclical feedback between credit and asset prices and containing unsustainable increases in leverage. A second, and at least equally important objective is to increase the resilience of borrowers and lenders to aggregate shocks (see further IMF 2013, IMF 2014a and IMF-FSB-BIS 2016). This resilience objective has not so far been the focus of the literature, even though it is arguably at least as important. We leave empirical investigation of the extent to which macroprudential policy can attain the resilience objective for future research.
13 Due to the frequency of some control variables, the macroprudential instrument indices are aggregated into a quarterly frequency.
14 As a robustness check, changes in domestic real interest rates are considered as an additional control. Our results point to similar findings both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance.

12
varying common factors such as global risk aversion, while country fixed effects (αi) capture time-invariant country-specific factors such as institutional characteristics.
The identification of macroprudential policy effects is based on a timing assumption— macroprudential policy does not affect macro-financial variables (e.g., credit growth) within the same quarter. This is a rather strong assumption, and the estimated coefficient of MaPPi,t-1 would be subject to the attenuation bias if the timing assumption did not hold (see further Appendix III), even as this is the typical approach taken in previous studies. We will return to this issue in Section IV.
The model is estimated for 63 countries (34 AEs and 29 EMDEs), where quarterly macro variables are available, over the period 1991 Q1 to 2016 Q4, using panel regressions with fixed effects. See Appendix IV for the list of countries, variable descriptions and sources, and their summary statistics.
B. The Effects of Policy Actions
We initially focus on the impact of aggregated indices of macroprudential policy on household credit growth (Table 1, columns 1–3). A tightening of any macroprudential measure (captured by the overall MaPP index) is, on average, associated with a decline in household credit growth of 0.8 percentage points (ppts), when all countries are considered. 15 The effects on household credit growth are typically more statistically significant and generally larger in EMDEs. For these countries, the impact amounts to a decline of almost 1.5 ppts.
Looking at sub-indices, loan-targeted tools are found to robustly affect household credit growth across all country groups. The loan-targeted tools include the LTV and DSTI limits (i.e., the “demand-side” tools) and those constraining bank loan supply (i.e., the “supply- loans” tools), such as restrictions on credit growth and loan loss provisions. Among loan- targeted measures, the supply-side measures are found to have larger effects on household credit than the demand-side measures. These effects are economically significant: a tightening event of loan supply tools is associated with an approximately 3 ppts decline in household credit growth after four quarters in both AEs and EMDEs. Other supply-side tools are found to have less potent effects in containing credit growth (“supply-general” and “supply-capital” in Table 1), in line with previous studies, and consistent with the idea that their main objective is to strengthen the resilience of the financial system.
15 The unconditional household credit growth averages about 8 ppts per year when all countries are considered. In EMDEs, it averages 11.6 ppts, while in AEs household credit increases yearly by 5.6 percent. See
Appendix IV Table 3.

Notes: The table reports the cumulative effects of the specified macroprudential tightening after four quarters, obtained by the fixed effects (FE) estimation. Each MaPP index/policy is considered individually. “dsti”= limits to the debt-service-to-income ratio, “ltv”= limits to the loan-to-value ratio, “tax”= tax measures, “lcg”= limits to credit growth, “llp”= loan loss provisions, “loanr”=loan restrictions, and “capital”=capital requirements. “MaPP index” is the sum of dummies for all of 17 categories. “Loan- targeted” group consists of the “Demand” and the “Supply-loans” instruments. “Demand”: LTV and DSTI. “Supply-loans”: lcg, llp, loanr, limits to the loan to deposit ratio, and limits to foreign currency loans. “Supply-general”: reserve requirements, liquidity requirements, and limits to FX positions. “Supply-capital”: leverage, countercyclical buffers, conservation buffers, and capital requirements. See Appendix I Table 3 for the definitions of instruments. For each country group, R-squared is computed as the average of the individual regressions. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.
Next, we examine the impact of individual macroprudential measures. Regarding the demand-side tools, the tightening of both DSTI and LTV limits are robustly and negatively associated with household credit. The estimated ppt declines are greater in EMDEs, where one tightening (loosening) action moderates (raises) household credit by about 6 percent for these tools.16 These results corroborate the findings of Cerutti and others (2017) and Kuttner
16 A few studies examine whether the effects are asymmetric between tightening and loosening measures, but the results are mixed, probably due to the small sample of loosening events. While Kuttner and Shim (2016) find stronger effects of tightening actions for 57 countries, Poghosyan (2019) reports the opposite for 28 EU countries. IMF (2012a,b) finds limited evidence for asymmetric effects for 36 countries.
 
14
and Shim (2016) who also find significant effects for demand-side tools.17 We also find that tightening actions concerning loan loss provisions and loan restrictions tend to slow household credit growth.
The effects of macroprudential policies on house prices are mostly weaker (Table 1, columns 4-6), in line with most existing studies.18 There is some evidence that loan-targeted macroprudential measures can mitigate house price growth, and these effects tend to be stronger in AEs, where housing markets tend to be more developed. They reduce house price growth by about one ppt for the entire sample and by 1.7 ppts for AEs. Among loan-targeted measures, demand-targeted policy actions appear to be the most potent ones.
Interestingly, in AEs, tax-related macroprudential policies, such as stamp duties on real estate transactions appear to dampen house price growth by a substantial 5 ppt, even as their impacts on household credit growth is statistically insignificant. One interpretation of this result is that tax-related measures can have an immediate effect on real estate valuations even if they do not materially affect transactions or credit developments. Another is that some of these tax measures are designed to deter foreign demand from pushing into local real estate markets. This foreign demand tends to be delinked from the domestic credit market, since most of those transactions are conducted with cash and do not involve domestic borrowing.
Turning to the side-effects, our goal is to quantify the consequences of macroprudential policies on macroeconomic outcomes such as a slowdown in private consumption (see Table 2, columns 1–3) and real GDP growth (Table 2, columns 4–6). These consequences are referred to as “side effects,” since they would not typically be the policy objective of macroprudential action (IMF 2012, Richter and others, 2018).
In the short run, macroprudential policies can be expected to weigh on consumption and growth for a couple of reasons. First, since they are typically designed to contain credit growth, they should slow investment and consumption. Second, to the extent that macroprudential policies dampen growth in asset prices, ensuing wealth effects are expected to reduce consumption and investment. Third, some tools, especially those working on the demand side (i.e., LTV and DSTI limits) may lead households to increase savings, in order to become eligible for a loan, again thereby reducing consumption.
17 Other studies, using different data and methods, also show that tighter LTV and DSTI limits reduce household credit growth (e.g., Lim and others 2011; Arregui and others 2013; Crowe and others 2013; Krznar and Morsink 2014; and Jácome and Mitra 2015). Also, Darbar and Wu (2015) and IMF (2018c) show that a tightening of LTV limits reduced the share of high LTV loans in several advanced economies, suggesting an improvement of housing loans.
18 Kuttner and Shim (2016) and Cerutti and others (2017) also find weaker effects on house prices compared to those on credit growth, while other studies provide evidence for contractionary effects on house prices (e.g., Vandenbussche and others 2015 and Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey, 2018). IMF (2014b) notes that if strong housing demand and house price growth are financed directly by foreign cash inflows (bypassing domestic credit intermediation), it can be difficult to contain house price growth using sectoral macroprudential tools.

Notes: The table reports the cumulative effects of the specified macroprudential tightening after four quarters, obtained by the fixed effects (FE) estimation with the timing assumption. Each MaPP index/policy is considered individually. “dsti”= limits to the debt-service-to-income ratio, “ltv”= limits to the loan-to-value ratio, “tax”= tax measures, “lcg”= limits to credit growth, “llp”= loan loss provisions, “loanr”=loan restrictions, and “capital”=capital requirements. “MaPP index” is the sum of dummies for all of
17 categories. “Loan-targeted” group consists of the “Demand” and the “Supply-loans” instruments. “Demand”: LTV and DSTI. “Supply-loans”: lcg, llp, loanr, limits to the loan to deposit ratio, and limits to foreign currency loans. “Supply-general”: reserve requirements, liquidity requirements, and limits to FX positions. “Supply-capital”: leverage, countercyclical buffers, conservation buffers, and capital requirements. For each country group, R-squared is computed as the average of the individual regressions. For more details see Appendix Tables 9 and 11. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.
In general, we find limited evidence of side effects on consumption. However, loan-targeted policy actions, especially those targeting the supply of bank loans, are negatively associated with private consumption growth. On average, a tightening of loan supply measures can reduce consumption growth by up to about 2 ppts, when all loan supply measures are combined in an index. The negative effects are stronger in AEs, where the share of consumption financed by credit may be larger than in EMDEs.
At the individual level, LTV limits and loan restrictions are found to reduce private consumption growth cumulatively by roughly 0.8 and 3.8 ppts after one year, respectively. Focusing on AEs, the effects of loan loss provisions and loan restrictions are negative and

16
statistically significant, with the magnitude of the effects ranging between 2.2 and 4.3 ppts. For EMDEs, the largest side effect is found for tax-related macroprudential policies, which reduce private consumption growth by 1.4 ppts.
When considering real GDP growth, the estimated side effects are weaker and generally not statistically significant (Table 2, columns 4-6). The only exception is the limits on credit growth in AEs, which reduce real GDP growth by 0.8 ppts (Table 2, column 5).
In summary, we confirm that loan-targeted policy actions have significant effects on household credit growth, while the effects on house prices are somewhat weaker. Contributing to a less explored strand of the literature, we also assess the short-term side- effects of macroprudential policy on consumption and find these effects to be relatively mild. Among the policy instruments considered, demand-side tools, such as DSTI and LTV limits, appear to be fairly efficient in the sense that they exhibit sizable effects on credit growth with more modest side-effects on consumption, although a welfare analysis is needed for a more comprehensive cost-benefit assessment. We return to this issue below, in the context of the estimation of effects of quantitative changes in the policy instrument.
C. Robustness Checks
Our results could be biased for several reasons. First, the estimated policy effects would be biased toward zero in the presence of reverse causality if the timing assumption of no contemporaneous policy effects did not hold (Appendix III). Second, although the iMaPP database includes more than one thousand policy actions, several tools are only utilized by a handful of countries. Third, the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable as a regressor could lead to a bias in the fixed-effect estimator (Nickell 1981), although the bias would be minimal given the long sample period.19 To assess the validity of our findings, various robustness checks are explored in Appendix V, including the system GMM panel estimates, while the reverse causality issue is addressed more formally in the next section’s analysis using a propensity-score-based method. The appendix also presents our extended analysis using quantile regression, which shows that macroprudential policies tend to reduce the incidence of credit booms.
IV. QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGES IN THE LTV LIMITS
A. Propensity-Score Based Approach
In this section, we move beyond the analysis typically presented in the literature in two ways. First, we quantify the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the LTV limit using our new indicator, the average LTV limit. Second, we examine whether the effects are non-

17
linear—that is, whether the effects of a one-percentage-point tightening are different, depending on the size of the overall amount of tightening and the starting level of the LTV limits. Third, we undertake additional efforts to identify causal effects, employing a propensity-score based approach.
The empirical challenge in identifying the causal effects of macroprudential policy is reverse causality, which could lead to endogeneity biases in estimation. Reverse causality is likely to be a problem in our context because the LTV limits are more likely to be tightened during periods of high credit growth (Figure 4). Therefore, estimations that do not address the issue are likely to be subject to attenuation bias. The typically used timing assumption (Section III) is unlikely to hold generally.20
We employ an inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimator specifically designed for our purposes. The use of propensity score methods is relatively new in the macroeconomics literature21 but widely spread in biostatistics. The IPW estimator identifies the causal effects of macroprudential policy by penalizing those observations that are likely to be affected by reverse causality. While there are many variants of IPW estimators, we use the Augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator, which achieves the smallest asymptotic variance in the class of the “doubly-robust” estimators.22
Specifically, the AIPW estimation of the effects of changes in LTV limits is conducted in three stages. In the first stage, an ordered logit model is estimated to obtain the propensity score—the probability of changing the LTV limit. The dependent variable is an ordered policy action indicator taking on the values {-20, -10, 0, 10, 20}, which represents the buckets in which the change in the LTV limit (ΔLTV) is grouped into (Table 3), and the regressors are macro variables that may influence policy actions (see Appendix VI for details). In the second stage, outcomes (e.g. credit growth) for each bucket of ΔLTV are predicted using macroeconomic variables to correct for unobserved outcomes. Then, in the third stage, the average treatment effect (ATE) on the outcome (e.g., credit growth) is estimated for each bucket of ΔLTV, using (1) the estimated inverse propensity-scores to put more (less) weights on the observations that are less (more) likely to be affected by reverse causality; and (2) the predicted outcomes in lieu of unobserved outcomes in the unrealized
20 Appendix III shows the attenuation bias in a typical regression model in the literature when the timing assumption does not hold.
21 Jordà and Taylor (2016), Angrist and others (2016), and Richter and others (2018) apply propensity-score based methods to estimate the effects of fiscal austerity, monetary policy, and macroprudential policy.
22 It is the class of the estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) that involves estimating both a treatment model and an outcome model; and that has a “doubly-robust” property—consistency of the estimated ATE only requires either the treatment model or the outcome model to be correctly specified. See, for example, Robins and others (1994) and Lunceford and Davidian (2004).

states.23 To obtain the estimated ATE of a one-percentage-change in the LTV limit, the estimated ATE is rescaled by the average ΔLTV for each bucket. The AIPW estimation is conducted with panel data of 58 countries over the period 2000 Q1 to 2016 Q4. The ATEs are reported only for tightening groups with more observations.

Notes: The table shows the summary statistics of the change in the average LTV limit for the four treatment groups and for the control group. Observations with ΔLTV less than or equal to -25 ppts are excluded for the estimation to mitigate the influence of outliers. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.
For comparison, we also estimate the effect of a one-percent-point LTV tightening using standard panel regression methods, based on the timing identification assumption (Appendix VII). When we examine whether results differ across subsamples, such as advanced- versus emerging market economies, we revert to the panel regression methods, since the AIPW estimation, which is already based on a bucketing approach, requires a relatively large number of observations.
B. The Effects of One-Percentage-Point Change in LTV Limits
The AIPW estimation results indicate strong and nonlinear effects of a one-ppt LTV tightening on household credit. For a tightening of less than 10 ppts, the cumulative decline in real household credit growth after four quarters is estimated at 0.65 ppts per one-ppt LTV tightening, while it is estimated at -0.36 ppts for a larger tightening by more than or equal to 10 ppts and less than 25 ppts (Panel 1of Figure 6).24 Interestingly, the estimated effects per
23 Please note that actual outcomes are only observed in a realized state—e.g., for countries that tighten their LTV limits, we cannot observe their outcome (e.g., credit growth) in the hypothetical scenario where they did not tighten (i.e., the unrealized state).
24 The average effect on household credit growth of any tightening measure is estimated at -0.31 ppts (compared to -0.16 ppts in the FE regression), based on the AIPW estimation with three buckets (i.e., the tightening, loosening, and control groups). Please note that, considering the observed nonlinearity, these linear models would likely be mis-specified. The linear model estimates are broadly comparable with the estimates by Richter and other (2018), although caution is needed when comparing the results because the definition of LTV limits differs—their LTV indicator includes loan prohibitions while ours do not. Their estimated effect on household credit growth ranges from -0.58 to -0.18 ppts—the per-action estimate of -4.1 ppts divided by the average LTV change per tightening of 7.1 ppts (with scope adjustments) or 22.5 ppts (without scope adjustments).
 
19
one-ppt tightening are diminishing with respect to the size of the LTV adjustment. The relatively smaller effects of larger tightening could be due to policy leakage (e.g., regulatory arbitrage) effects. For example, if the LTV limits only cover domestic bank loans, a strong tightening could incentivize arbitrage and thus increase non-bank credit or credit from abroad when these loans are not covered by the limit, offsetting the policy effects on domestic bank credit (e.g., IMF 2013 and 2014, and IMF-FSB-BIS, 2016). The magnitude of the estimated effects depends on the choices of thresholds for tightening groups, partly due to the nonlinearity but for large LTV changes also due to the relatively limited number of observations and the influence of outliers.

Notes: The figure reports the cumulative effects of a one-ppt LTV tightening after four quarters, obtained by the augmented inverse propensity-score weighted (“AIPW”) estimation and the fixed effects estimation with the timing assumption (“FE regression”), which are explained in detail in Appendices VI and VII, respectively. The FE regression uses the interaction terms of ΔLTV with the dummy variables for each bucket (i.e., a tightening by less than 10 ppts and a tightening by more than or equal to 10 ppts and less than 25 ppts). To mitigate the influence of outliers, observations with ΔLTV less than or equal to -25 ppts are excluded for the estimation. Confidence levels: *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1. Standard errors are clustered by country.
The fixed effect (FE) estimation based on the timing assumption also finds nonlinear effects on household credit, but the estimates are not significant and are smaller than the AIPW estimates (Panel 1 of Figure 6).25 This result supports the idea that the typical regression estimates based on the timing assumption suffer from an attenuation bias (Appendix III) and that the AIPW better addresses the endogeneity issue.
The estimated side effects are found to be smaller and less robust. The AIPW estimates of the consumption growth decline are around 0.1 ppts, and without a clear nonlinear pattern
(Panel 2 of Figure 6). Taking this together with the nonlinear effects on credit, a tightening by less than 10 ppts appears to be more efficient in the sense that it has larger effects on

credit but smaller side effects on consumption, although a formal welfare analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.
C. Do Initial LTV Levels Matter?
It is conceivable that a given change in the LTV limits could have differential impacts on macro-financial outcomes depending on whether the starting level of the LTV ratio cap is still relatively loose, or already tight. To examine this hypothesis, we estimate the effects conditioning on the level of LTV limits. The threshold levels sorting loose and tight initial levels are set to 100 percent in AEs and 90 percent in EMs, which corresponds to the median LTV level for each of these two groups.26 We then define the LTV limits to be “tight” for all observations below these thresholds (i.e. for low permissible LTV). Using different cut-off levels yields broadly similar results. We use the panel regression with the timing assumption for the results distinguishing AEs and EMDEs, while we also conduct the AIPW estimation as a robustness check without distinguishing AEs and EMDEs.
The results suggest that the initial LTV level matters, especially for household consumption, with the effect of an additional tightening on consumption larger when LTV limits are already tight. In general, a tightening of the LTV limits by one percentage point is only significantly associated with a decline in consumption if the LTV is already tight, and this result is consistent across subsamples (Panel 2 of Figure 7).
In contrast, the effects on household credit growth of a tightening of LTV limits are generally more pronounced when starting from a loose level, such as when the LTV measures are first introduced. The effects on household credit in AEs are only significant when the initial level of the LTV cap is loose (above or equal to 100 percent). In EMDEs, the effects of tightening LTV limits are also slightly stronger when the initial LTV levels are high, even if the difference is not always statistically significant, (Panel 1 of Figure 7).
These insights are corroborated when using the AIPW method. Excluding the observations with initial LTV levels higher or equal to 100 percent, the estimated effect on household credit becomes smaller but the side effect on consumption increases compared with the full sample results (Appendix VI Table 1).
Differential effects on credit (stronger when the initial level of the LTV cap is loose) and on consumption (stronger when initial level of the LTV cap is tight), can conceivably be reconciled by noting that when the starting point is a loose initial level, and when borrowers then face a tightening of the permissible LTV ratio, many borrowers will adjust to this change by reducing the size of the loan and meeting the higher required downpayment out of

21
existing own funds. While this implies a drop in credit, the typical borrower will still go ahead with the home purchase, and the drop in consumption may not be pronounced. Conversely, when the initial LTV is already tight and it is further tightened, more borrowers are in a situation where they had already reduced credit (i.e., did not buy the house) and now do not reduce borrowing further, but rather increase savings to attain the new LTV limit. Thus, the decline in consumption is more substantial in this case.
Judging from the results for both household credit and consumption, we conclude that there is a tradeoff in tightening LTV limits, with the tightening of this measure having relatively more substantial side effects on consumption when initial LTV limits are already tight. This suggests that countries with tight LTV limits might be better off considering other macroprudential tools to complement the existing portfolio of tools, which is in line with international best practices (IMF-FSB-BIS, 2016).

For more details see Appendix VIII Table 15.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented a new comprehensive database of macroprudential policies (iMaPP) that combines information from various sources. Exploiting the unique features of this database and using a method that aims to better address endogeneity problems, we found strong and nonlinear effects on household credit of LTV changes. The effects per one percentage point (ppt) LTV tightening are diminishing with the size of the LTV adjustment, likely due to policy leakage effects. The largest per-unit impact is found for the most popular action in our sample—a tightening of less than 10 ppts—and it indicates that a one ppt LTV tightening cumulatively reduces household credit growth by up to 0.65 ppts after one year.

22
This result highlights the importance of considering nonlinearity in estimating policy effects, as well as reverse causality.
We also made progress toward assessing side effects of macroprudential policies, by investigating their impact on private consumption. These effects are statistically significant, but more moderate in size relative to effects on household credit. We also establish a nonlinearity in the effects of tightening of LTV limits on consumption, with the effect of an additional tightening larger when LTV limits are already tight.
The new iMaPP database will be updated annually with data from the IMF’s new Annual Survey on Macroprudential Policies, offering many opportunities for further research. Among the issues that deserve further exploration are the quantification of the effects of other macroprudential policies and the cost-benefit analysis of macroprudential policies.27
 27 See Brandao and others (forthcoming) for further progress in this regard.

APPENDIX I. THE IMAPP DATABASE
We construct the iMaPP database integrating information from major existing databases and national sources. The integrated databases are Lim and others (2011, 2013), the Global Macroprudential Policy Instrument (GMPI) survey conducted by the IMF in 2013, Shim and others (2013), the database by European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), and the IMF’s Annual Macroprudential Policy Survey (IMF survey). We also obtain information from national sources; the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the IMF official documents. Appendix I Figure 1 visualizes how each source contributes to the iMaPP database. Going forward, the iMaPP database will be annually updated with the IMF’s Annual Macroprudential Policy Survey.
Data availability differs across time and countries, largely reflecting reporting differences. The number of observations improves over time, particularly after 2000 (Section II.D.). Also, there are relatively more observations for 65 countries (listed in Appendix I Table 1), whose information comes from several sources. Appendix I Table 2 lists the 66 economies where the average LTV limit is available.
Appendix I Table 3 lists all the categories of macroprudential instruments available in the iMaPP database, and their definitions.

Appendix I Table 4 shows how the iMaPP database compares with other existing databases of macroprudential policy. First, it shows that the iMaPP database has a wider coverage of instruments, countries, and sample periods. Second, it shows that the iMaPP database provides the average LTV limit as well as traditional dummy-type policy action indices, while most existing databases provide dummy-type indices only. Exceptions are Vandenbussche and others (2015) and Richter and others (2018), who provides intensity- adjusted policy indices.

Definition
A requirement for banks to maintain a countercyclical capital buffer. Implementations at 0% are not considered as a tightening in dummy-type indicators.
Requirements for banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer, including the one established under Basel III.
Capital requirements for banks, which include risk weights, systemic risk buffers, and minimum capital requirements. Countercyclical capital buffers and capital conservation buffers are captured in their sheets respectively and thus not included here. Subcategories of capital measures are also provided, classifying them into household sector targeted (HH), corporate sector targeted (Corp), broad-based (Gen), and FX-loan targeted (FX) measures. Alimitonleverageofbanks,calculatedbydividingameasureofcapitalbythebank’snon-risk- weighted exposures (e.g., Basel III leverage ratio).
Loan loss provision requirements for macroprudential purposes, which include dynamic provisioning and sectoral provisions (e.g. housing loans).
Limits on growth or the volume of aggregate credit, the household-sector credit, or the corporate-sector credit by banks, and penalties for high credit growth. Subcategories of limits to credit growth are also provided, classifying them into household sector targeted (HH), corporate sector targeted (Corp), and broad-based (Gen) measures.
Loan restrictions, that are more tailored than those captured in "LCG". They include loan limits and prohibitions, which may be conditioned on loan characteristics (e.g., the maturity, the size, the LTV ratio and the type of interest rate of loans), bank characteristics (e.g., mortgage banks), and other factors. Subcategories of loan restrictions are also provided, classifying them into household sector targeted (HH), and corporate sector targeted (Corp) measures. Restrictions on foreign currency lending are captured in "LFC".
Limits on foreign currency (FC) lending, and rules or recommendations on FC loans.
Limits to the loan-to-value ratios, including those mostly targeted at housing loans, but also includes those targeted at automobile loans, and commercial real estate loans.
Limits to the debt-service-to-income ratio and the loan-to-income ratio, which restrict the size of debt services or debt relative to income. They include those targeted at housing loans, consumer loans, and commercial real estate loans.
Taxes and levies applied to specified transactions, assets, or liabilities, which include stamp duties, and capital gain taxes.
Measures taken to mitigate systemic liquidity and funding risks, including minimum requirements for liquidity coverage ratios, liquid asset ratios, net stable funding ratios, core funding ratios and external debt restrictions that do not distinguish currencies.
Limits to the loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio and penalties for high LTD ratios.
Limits on net or gross open foreign exchange (FX) positions, limits on FX exposures and FX funding, and currency mismatch regulations.
Reserve requirements (domestic or foreign currency) for macroprudential purposes. Please note that this category may currently include those for monetary policy as distinguishing those for macroprudential or monetary policy purposes is often not clear-cut. A subcategory of reserve requirements is provided for those differentiated by currency (FCD), as they are typically used for macroprudential purposes.
Measures taken to mitigate risks from global and domestic systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), which includes capital and liquidity surcharges.
Macroprudential measures not captured in the above categories—e.g., stress testing, restrictions on profit distribution, and structural measures (e.g., limits on exposures between financial institutions).

APPENDIX II. CONSTRUCTING THE AVERAGE LTV LIMIT
Constructing average LTV limits requires a few adjustments. First, when a country introduces a LTV limit on a new category of loans, for the periods prior to the introduction, we set the value at 100 for the category. This treatment is necessary for the average LTV limit to correctly suggest a tightening when an LTV limit is introduced for an additional loan category, as illustrated in Appendix II Table 1. When the introduced regulatory limits on LTV ratios are above 100 percent (e.g., as in Netherlands and Slovakia), we set the value at 110 for the periods prior to the introduction.28 Second, when a country does not have any LTV limits, we set the value at 100, to be consistent with the logic of the first treatment.
The average LTV limit series summarizes reasonably well regulatory developments even when there are multiple LTV limits in a country. For example, if we alternatively choose the tightest limit, instead of the simple average, there would be a risk to miss regulatory changes in another important loan category if the regulatory LTV limits in that category were not the tightest. By contrast, the simple average of regulatory LTV limits reflects changes in all categories. And empirically, its evolution exhibits a picture consistent with the dummy-type index for the developments of LTV limits.
Please note that the average LTV limit, as well as dummy-type policy action indicators, are recorded based on their effective dates, because the announcement dates are often not available. The text information in the iMaPP database contains the announcement dates when they are available.

Notes: In this illustration, without any treatment, the average LTV limit mistakenly appears as a loosening when the LTV limit on “mortgages for other houses” is introduced in January 2000, although it should be a tightening. With the treatment to set the value at 100 (in red) for the periods prior to the introduction, the average LTV limit correctly indicates the event as a tightening.
28 110 percent is an ad-hoc value, although average LTV ratio of all existing mortgage loans in Netherlands were about 110 percent when the LTV limits were introduced.

APPENDIX III. ATTENUATION BIAS IN A STANDARD REGRESSION ANALYSIS
To identify the causal effects of macroprudential policy (MaPP), previous studies typically use the timing assumption of no contemporaneous policy effects. That is, macroprudential policy does not affect macro-financial variables (e.g., credit growth) within the same quarter. This appendix shows when the approach is valid and when it fails and thus suffers from the attenuation bias.
Consider a structural form vector autoregression (VAR) with one lag (without the constant
�1 −𝛽𝛽��𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 �=�𝛼𝛼11 𝛼𝛼12��𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡−1 �+�𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡�,
� 𝜀𝜀 𝑡𝑡 � ~ 𝑖𝑖 . 𝑖𝑖 . 𝑑𝑑 . � � 0 � , � 𝜎𝜎 𝜀𝜀2 0 � � , 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 0 0 𝜎𝜎𝜂𝜂2
where 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 is credit and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 is a MaPP measure, with 𝛽𝛽 ≤ 0 (credit reduces when MaPP tightens) and 𝛾𝛾 ≥ 0 (MaPP tightens when credit increases). Then the reduced form VAR is:
� 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 �= 1 �𝛼𝛼11 +𝛽𝛽𝛼𝛼21 𝛼𝛼12 +𝛽𝛽𝛼𝛼22�� 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡−1 �+ 1 �𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 1−𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛼𝛼11+𝛼𝛼21 𝛾𝛾𝛼𝛼12+𝛼𝛼22 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1 1−𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡
+ 𝛽𝛽𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡�. Regressing 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 on (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡−1, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1) provides the estimated coefficient on 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1, which will
  converge to: 𝛼𝛼12 + 𝛽𝛽𝛼𝛼22,
1 − 𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾
where 𝛼𝛼12 captures the direct impact from 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1 to 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 and 𝛽𝛽𝛼𝛼22 captures the indirect impact through 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡, while the denominator 1 − 𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾 shrinks the total impact. Thus, if 𝛽𝛽 ≠ 0 and 𝛾𝛾 ≠
 0 (i.e., 𝛽𝛽𝛾𝛾 ≤ 0), this lag approach ends up with an attenuation bias towards zero on the impact. This bias is severer if the contemporaneous policy effect (𝛽𝛽) is stronger (e.g., faster transmission, or if the reverse causality effect (𝛾𝛾) is stronger (e.g., quicker policy formulation upon developments).
If 𝛽𝛽 = 0 (i.e., no contemporaneous policy effect), then the OLS coefficient on 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1 would be the total impact of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1 on 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡. That is, the lag approach is valid when there is no contemporaneous policy effect, which is the timing assumption commonly assumed in the literature. If there is no reverse causality (i.e., 𝛾𝛾 = 0) to begin with, then the approach is of course valid, too.
The attenuation-bias argument will still hold, even if the left-hand-side variables are
(𝐶𝐶 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ), in the spirit of the local projection. The interpretation of 𝛼𝛼 is only changed
𝑡𝑡+1 𝑡𝑡+1 12 to the impact from 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1 to 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1, instead of 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡.
The results hold for a more general setting with the constant term and any other control variables included in the regressors, because of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem.

APPENDIX IV. DATA FOR THE PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH DUMMY-TYPE INDICATORS
Appendix IV Table 1 provides the definitions and sources of the variables used in regression analysis in Sections III and IV. Appendix IV Table 2 provides the list of sample economies used in panel regression analysis in Section III. Appendix IV Table 3 provides the summary statistics of the variables used in estimation.
MaPP variables used in Section III are the average of the net number of policy tightening over the current and past three quarters to account for potentially delayed effects. They are constructed for individual instruments and for groups of instruments. “Loan-targeted” group consists of the “Demand” and the “Supply-loans” instruments. “Demand” instruments are the limits to the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and the limits to the debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratio. “Supply-loans” measures are limits to credit growth (LCG), loan loss provisions (LLP), loan restrictions (LoanR), limits to the loan to deposit ratio, and limits to foreign currency loans. “Supply-general” instruments are reserve requirements, liquidity requirements, and limits to FX positions. “Supply-capital” instruments are leverage limits (LVR), countercyclical buffers (CCB), conservation buffers, and capital requirements. “MaPP index” is the sum of the dummies for all of 17 categories (see also Appendix I Table 3).
The distinction between demand-side and supply-side tools is whether the tool is on the borrowers (i.e., credit demand) or on the financial institutions (i.e., credit supply). This is in line with the classification in Kuttner and Shim (2016).

Notes: Individual macroprudential variables and aggregated MaPP indices are presented as the year-on-year average (yoy mean). The MaPP index consists of all 17 individual macroprudential measures. All Loan-related consists of Demand-related and Supply Loan measures. Demand-related includes debt-service-to-income (DSTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) limits. Supply All measures are divided into General, Capital, and Loan. Supply General consists of reserve requirements (RR), liquidity requirements (LR), and limits on foreign exchange positions (LFX). Supply Capital consists of capital requirements (CAPITAL), conservation buffers (CONSERVATION B), the leverage ratio (LVR), capital surcharges for systemically important financial institutions (SIFI), and countercyclical capital buffers (CCB). Supply Loan consists of limits on credit growth (LCG), loan loss provisions (LLP), loan restrictions (LOANR), and limits on foreign currency loans (LFC). For further details, see Appendix I Table 3. Summary statistics are presented for the set of 63 countries used in the regression analysis. AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

APPENDIX V. ROBUSTNESS OF THE PANEL REGRESSION RESULTS WITH DUMMY-TYPE INDICATORS
System GMM results
The inclusion of a lag of the dependent variable may lead to biased estimates (Nickell 1981), even though the time dimension is large in in our sample. Therefore, as a robustness exercise, we use System GMM techniques, following Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) and executing them using xtbond2 in Stata (Roodman, 2009), and compare the estimates with the fixed effect estimates (see Appendix VIII Tables 1-4). This robustness check confirms that our baseline results are consistent with the GMM estimates, proving that the Nickell bias is marginal in this context. In general, magnitudes and significance are slightly stronger for the GMM estimates.
Quantile regressions
Quantile regressions help us examine the effects of macroprudential policy on the whole distribution of macro-financial variables, instead of focusing on average effects as in the baseline model. 29 These results could indicate whether the policy is effective in reducing the probability of high credit growth, for example.
We estimate quantile panel regressions with non-additive fixed effects (Powell 2016; 2015; Koenker 2004; Koenker and Hallock 2001), conditional on an observable vector of the lag of country-specific variables (X). Specifically, for each quantile τ (i.e., 10th and 90th percentile, respectively), the following equation is estimated:
𝑄𝑄�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡�𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1, 𝜏𝜏� = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖(𝜏𝜏) + 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡(𝜏𝜏) + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1𝛽𝛽(𝜏𝜏) + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡(𝜏𝜏), (A.V.1) where α and μ are country- and time- fixed effects, respectively, and ε the error terms.
The effects on household credit are found to be stronger in reducing the probability of credit booms (Appendix VIII Table 5, columns 3, 6, and 9). The results seem to be particularly relevant for AEs, reducing the 90th percentile of the credit growth distribution significantly (column 6). In general, tightening measures affecting bank capital are found to mitigate the probability of high credit growth. For example, household credit at the 90th percentile declines by about 2.5 percent when capital requirements are tightened, although the effects are not statistically significant on the lower tail (i.e., quantile = 0.1, column 1). For AEs, the DSTI limits reduces the high credit episodes, slowing the 90th percentile credit growth by 1.5 ppts, although their effects are not significant on average (FE) or at the lower tail
29 In a separate exercise, we condition our baseline panel regressions on episodes with private credit gap positive for at least three quarters, i.e., during a protracted credit boom. Those findings are similar to the quantile regressions (at the 90th percentile).

(columns 4-6). Similarly, for house prices, we find stronger effects on the right tail of the distribution for selected measures (Appendix VIII Table 7).
The side effects also seem stronger at the right tail of the private consumption distribution for AEs (Appendix VIII Table 6). They are larger in magnitude when loan-targeted and demand- side measures are deployed. For instance, LTV limits reduce private consumption growth by about one ppt at the 90th percentile of its distribution, indicating a reduction of the probability of high consumption growth. They also appear to reduce the episodes of high real output growth (Appendix VIII Table 8).

Baseline AIPW estimation
The AIPW estimator of the average treatment effect (ATE) is defined as follows:
∆h,𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁�∆h,𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴, �1�

APPENDIX VI. AIPW ESTIMATION
In Section IV, we use a propensity-score based approach, combined with a local projection method to estimate the policy effects for different horizons (Angrist and others 2016, Jordà and Taylor, 2016, and Richter and others 2018). Among many variants of propensity-score estimators, we chose the Augmented Inverse-Propensity-Score Weighted (AIPW) estimator, which is the most efficient estimator in the class of “doubly-robust” estimators.30
(A.VI.1)
  h is the horizon, 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 is the dummy variable of treatment j for country n and time t (with j = 0
indicating the control group—i.e., no change in the average LTV limit), 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 is the
propensity score of treatment j, and 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗(𝑿𝑿𝑶𝑶) is the predicted outcome of treatment j. The
AIPW estimation involves estimating (1) a treatment model to obtain the propensity scores and (2) outcome models to address the distortion due to the unobserved outcomes.
Treatment model: To obtain the propensity scores (𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡), we estimate the following ordered logit model with time and country dummies for fixed effects and obtain the propensity scores
𝑧𝑧∗ = 𝑿𝑿𝑻𝑻𝜷𝜷𝑻𝑻 + 𝑒𝑒 (A.VI.2) where 𝑧𝑧∗: dltv (=-20, -10, 0, 10, 20), and 𝑿𝑿𝑻𝑻 includes a lag of real household debt growth, a
lag of real GDP growth, a lag of the interest rate, time-dummies, and country-dummies. Each value of dltv represents one of the following groups: a tightening of more than or equal to
10 ppts and less than 25 ppts (-20); a tightening of less than 10 ppts (-10); no change (0—the control group); an easing of less than 10 ppts (10); and an easing of more than or equal to
10 ppts (20).
Estimation with country- or time-dummies may generate inconsistent estimates due to the incidental parameters problem under fixed-T (or N). The bias is small, though, when T (or N) is large, as in our case.31 Nevertheless, we tried alternative specifications (such as dropping
30 See Lunceford and Davidian (2004) and Jordà and Taylor (2016), for example. 31 See, e.g., Wooldridge (2010, p 612), Dickerson and others (2011).
 
35
time dummies and adding the VIX and quarter dummies) and found that this did not affect the results much.
The estimated distribution of the propensity score for the treated and control units overlaps reasonably well (Appendix VI Figure 1). In the baseline, we truncate the inverse of the propensity scores at 10 to avoid the instability, as in Jordà and Taylor (2016).32 We also tried different truncations (e.g., at 100) but this did not affect the results significantly.

Notes: The propensity score is estimated using the ordered logit model. The treatment groups are (1) a tightening of greater than or equal to 10 ppts and less than 25 ppts, (2) a tightening of less than 10 ppts, (3) an easing by less than 10 ppts, and (4) an easing of greater than or equal to 10 ppts; and the control group is no change. Observations with ΔLTV less than or equal to - 25 ppts are excluded for the estimation to mitigate the influence of outliers. The figure shows the predicted probabilities of the specified treatment, with the red bars for the specified treatment group and the white bars for the control group.
Outcome model: To obtain the treatment-specific predicted outcomes (𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗(𝑿𝑿𝑶𝑶)), we estimate the following regression model for each treatment group and the control group:
∆h𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠=0 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠h∆𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−𝑠𝑠 + 𝑿𝑿𝑶𝑶𝜷𝜷𝑶𝑶 + 𝑒𝑒 (A.VI.3)
 32 Since the propensity scores takes small values, the AIPW estimator could become unstable as the inverse of the propensity scores can take huge values.

get the AIPW estimator and its standard error clustered by country, as in Jordà and Taylor (2016). Please note that these standard errors would miss the uncertainty in the treatment- and outcome- model estimation, and thus probably tend to be smaller—i.e., statistical significance tend to be overstated. A one-step estimation or a bootstrap method would be needed to obtain correct standard errors.
AIPW estimation on the effects of initial LTV levels

estimate the AIPW model, excluding the observations with high initial LTV levels
The AIPW estimates find a consistent result for the group of a tightening by less than
10 ppts. When excluding the observations with high initial LTV levels, the estimated effect on credit gets smaller but the side effect on consumption gets larger (Appendix IV Table 1). It is not feasible to provide the AIPW estimates for AEs and EMDEs, separately, due to the limited observation of LTV changes.

APPENDIX VII: QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF LTV CHANGES (Identification based on the Timing Assumption)
Empirical design
In section IV, in addition to the AIPW estimation, we also conduct panel regressions with various controls to quantify the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the LTV limit on real household credit growth and real private consumption. Specifically, we estimate the following equation:
𝛥𝛥𝐶𝐶=ρ∆C +∑ 𝛽𝛽𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉 +∑ 𝜸𝜸𝑿𝑿 +𝛼𝛼+𝜇𝜇+𝜖𝜖, (A.VII.1) 4 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 4 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 𝑠𝑠=1 𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑠𝑠 𝑙𝑙=1 𝒍𝒍 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−𝑙𝑙 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡
4 𝐿𝐿
where i is country, t is the time (quarter). The dependent variable, ∆4𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 , refers to year-on-
year growth rate of real household credit. 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is the percentage point changes in the
average LTV limits in country i and quarter t. The lags of 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 are included to capture
replace 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉 with the interaction term 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉 ⋅ 𝑍𝑍 , where 𝑍𝑍 is the dummy variable that 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡

takes one if 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is in a specified range (e.g., 𝛥𝛥𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡∈(-10,0)) for Section IV.B.; and the initial LTV level for Section IV.C. The lag of ∆4𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is also included as a regressor to capture any autonomous dynamics in real credit growth, and a vector 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 includes other control variables, such as real GDP growth, domestic real interest rates and other macroprudential policies. Time (μt) and country (αi) fixed effects capture time-varying common factors such as global risk aversion and time-invariant country-specific factors such as location or institutional characteristics.
The dependent variable refers to total private credit to household sector (in real terms), which includes both mortgage and consumer credit from all sources.34 When considering side effects, we replace the dependent variable with real private consumption growth. The identification of LTV effects is based on the timing assumption—LTV limits do not affect credit growth within the same quarter. The model is estimated with quarterly data from about 58 countries over the period 2000 Q1 to 2016 Q4 using panel regressions with fixed effects.35
To examine whether these effects differ across country characteristics, we estimate equation (A.VII.1) with country group subsamples (for instance, EMDE/AE; regions such as Asia, Europe, and Americas; among the countries with high exchange rate flexibility, high capital
34 This choice is justified given that mortgage data are scarcer across countries and time than total household credit data.
35 As a robustness check, we employ the system GMM technique, following Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). However, given our time span at the quarterly frequency, the so-called Nickell bias (Nickell 1981) should be less of a concern. For this robustness exercise see Appendix VIII Tables 13 and 14.

openness, high financial development; countries with high debt-to-income ratios among low- income borrowers), or conditioning on a positive credit gap.36
Results: The effects of changes in the LTV limits
First, we examine the effects of ΔLTV limit on real household credit. Our main focus is the sum of the ΔLTV coefficients, which encompasses the cumulative effects of the previous
4 lags (Appendix VIII Table 9). These effects are found significant for EMDEs, Asia and Pacific region, in countries with high indebtedness level of the low-income borrowers, as well as when credit gap is positive in EMDEs. The magnitude of a one ppt tightening of LTV limit on real household credit varies from about 0.07 ppts to 0.37 ppts. These estimates are similar to those presented in the previous sections. In addition, our results are comparable with those by Richter et al (2018).
Turning to the control variables, the positive and close-to-unity estimates of the lagged credit growth suggest a high degree of persistence in yearly credit growth. This coefficient ranges from a minimum of 0.82 for North and Latin American countries to a maximum of 0.97 in countries with high indebtedness level of the low-income borrowers. As expected, higher short-term interest rates are found to negatively impact future household credit growth. These interest rate effects are found slightly stronger in EMDEs than in AEs. Unsurprisingly, this relationship holds well for European countries, where the common monetary policy, trade and economic integration translates into a homogenous negative relationship. Lastly, the state of the business cycle is proxied by the past output growth, which is found to be positively associated with credit growth.
We also assess the impact of ΔLTV on real private consumption (see Appendix VIII Table 10). The effects are significant when all countries are considered, as well as for the EMDE group, for countries with highly indebted low-income borrowers, and when EMDEs experience a credit boom. The magnitude of one ppt tightening of LTV limit on real private consumption vary from about 0.08 ppts to 0.18 ppts.37
These results are robust to controlling for other macroprudential policies (Appendix VIII Tables 11-12), and to the use of the Arellano-Bover-Blundell-Bond system GMM estimator (Appendix VIII Tables 13-14).
36 Using micro-level household surveys, countries are split into high/low indebtedness of low-income borrowers if the average debt-to-income ratio of the bottom 40 percent households by income is above/below the median.
37 Likewise, robustness checks show broadly significant and equal magnitudes for all countries, the EMDE group, or when EMDEs experience credit booms, when controlling for other macroprudential measures or using GMM techniques (see Appendix VIII Tables 12 and 14).

Notes: The table reports the cumulative effects of the specified macroprudential tightening after four quarters, obtained by the fixed effects (FE) estimation with the timing assumption. In addition to country and time fixed effects, each specification includes the lagged dependent variable, real output growth (lag), and domestic interest rates (lag). Each macroprudential policy indicator is the average over the previous four quarters and is considered individually. Quantile regressions refer to 10th and 90th percentile, respectively. Period sample: 1991Q1 – 2016Q4. AE = advanced economies; and EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Standard errors clustered at the country-level are reported in parentheses. Confidence levels: *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1

            <Title>Macroprudential policy: what instruments and how to use them</Title>
            <Text>- Macroprudential instruments are typically introduced with the objective of reducing systemic risk, either over time or across institutions and markets
- Credit-related, i.e., caps on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, caps on the debt-to-income
(DTI) ratio, caps on foreign currency lending and ceilings on credit or credit growth;
-Liquidity-related, i.e., limits on net open currency positions/currency mismatch
(NOP), limits on maturity mismatch and reserve requirements;7
-Capital-related, i.e., countercyclical/time-varying capital requirements, timevarying/dynamic provisioning, and restrictions on profit distribution
- Figure 2 shows objectives of macroprudential policy
- Macroprudential instruments are generally more targeted than monetary and fiscal policy tools, and they are frequently further differentiated for specific types of transactions. Caps on
 he LTV and DTI, for example, have been applied according to the loan size, the location and the value of the property (Hong Kong SAR and Korea). Reserve requirements used for macroprudential purposes have been differentiated by currency, types of liabilities, and applied within a band or on a marginal basis, or if credit growth exceeds the official limit (Argentina, Chile, China, Indonesia, Peru, Russia, Serbia, and Turkey). Sometimes social and other developmental aspects are taken into account when the instruments are calibrated
(Canada)
- However, most countries that participated in the IMF
survey have used judgment almost entirely when designing and calibrating the instruments.
The implementation of the instruments is a learning-by-doing process, in which judgment on
how to calibrate an instrument is often formed by trial and error, depending on the type of
shock the system is facing</Text>

            <Title>Externalities and Macroprudential Policies </Title>
            <Text>- The correction of these externalities can be seen as intermediate targets for macroprudential policy, since policies that control externalities mitigate market failures that create systemic risk. 
- s systemic risk, that is, “the risk of developments that threaten the stability of the financial system as a whole and consequently the broader economy” (Bernanke, 2009)
- The focus on macroprudential policy is motivated by the fact that microprudential regulation is necessary but not sufficient to deal with systemic risk
- The main finding is that the three externalities identified may be corrected by various tools,
and each tool has benefits and limitations
- policies addressing the same externality are best seen as complements
- Another lesson of the crisis is that microprudential regulation is not always suited to address
systemic risk. In fact, ensuring the stability of each institution individually can at times
destabilize the system as a whole. For example, capital ratios set independently of the
business cycle may be a source of systemic risk.
- This approach clarifies that macroprudential policies are justified by the need to correct market failures, and not simply because the financial system is “fragile.”
- One reason why banks and other financial intermediaries choose to correlate their risk is
because of strategic complementarities, meaning that the payoff from a certain strategy
increases with the number of other agents undertaking the same strategy 
- In the presence of imperfect information,
banks’ incentives to assess borrower risk depend on their strategic interaction. In booms,
banks have fewer incentives to screen potential borrowers due to lower rents prompted by
fiercer competition. As a result, they reduce screening intensity and increase lending. This
causes a worsening of the pool of borrowers, which is reversed through lower credit
origination and milder competitive pressures once the business cycle’s contractionary phase
sets in 
- d SIFIs introduces a race among financial institutions to become systemically important, as this implies a lower cost of funding in normal times and a better protection against losses when in distress
- The ultimate goal of macroprudential policy is to reduce “systemic risk”
- This broad definition of systemic risk is not, however, well-suited for the formulation of macroprudential policy because it does not highlight the sources of systemic risk: market failures. 
- The approach taken in this paper is to view macroprudential policy as a tool to correct
externalities that create systemic risk.
- What gives these instruments a macroprudential flavor is that
they are not imposed to resolve agency conflicts within a bank, but rather to correct
externalities that arise between banks. Consequently, these measures do not depend on bank
characteristics taken in isolation (as for microprudential regulation), but are contingent on the
aggregate behavior of all banks (e.g., the lending cycle) or the position of a bank within the
financial system (e.g., systemic importance)
- Both tools
limit banks’ expected gains from choosing correlated lending strategies: capital requirements
induce banks to internalize more of the cost of engaging in risky lending; restrictions on asset
allocation prevent banks from taking large risk exposures. By limiting asset growth in the
upturn of the credit cycle, these tools can reduce the cost associated with adjustments in
downturns. 
-. For example, deviations from trend (gaps) in the credit-to-GDP ratio, property prices, risk premia, or leverage can be used to identify externalities related to strategic complementarities or imbalances that lead to fire sales in downturns (Drehmann et al., 2011; IMF, 2011b; Dell’Ariccia et al., 2012). Similarly, measures of systemic risk contribution, such as CoVaR (Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2011) and systemic shortfall (Acharya et al., 2010; Drehmann and Tarashev, 2011b) can proxy externalities related to interconnectedness.</Text>

            <Text>APA PAPER TEMPLATE

About
This template is designed to produce a paper that adheres to the APA (American Psychological Association) format. However, you should check the exact guidelines of the institution to which you are submitting your paper, as there can be slight variations in expectations.

How To Use This Template
	•	Unless otherwise stated, you do not need to worry about the font and formatting you use to write your paper in Scrivener—the required formatting will be applied to the printed or exported document during Compile.
	•	Likewise, the titles for each section will be added during Compile, so you only need to write the text for each section—do not type out any titles in the editor.
	•	Write the text of your abstract in the “Abstract” document.
	•	Write your introduction in the “Introduction” document.
	•	Compose the main body of your paper in text documents inside the “Main Content” folder. When compiled, the style of heading used for documents inside the “Main Content” folder will be determined by their indentation. As per the APA specifications:
	⁃	Documents indented one level inside the “Main Content” folder (“Method”, “Results” and “Discussion”) will be treated as Level 1 APA sections, with bold and centred titles.
	⁃	Documents indented two levels deep in the “Main Content” folder (“Participants”, “Research Design”, and so on) will be treated as Level 2 APA sections, with bold and left-aligned titles.
	⁃	Documents indented three levels deep in the “Main Content” folder will be treated as Level 3 APA sections and their titles will be bold and inserted at the start of the text rather than on their own line.
	⁃	APA Level 4 and Level 5 headings are supported in the same way.
	•	Note that the documents provided inside the “Main Content” folder are just by way of example and can be deleted or renamed as necessary.
	•	Indent block quotes or other special passages using styles. For instance, to add a block quote, choose “Block Quote” from the Format &gt; Style menu (or from the styles button in the format bar). The required APA formatting will be applied to block quotes during Compile.
	•	For specially-formatted passages you can also use the exact formatting you require and enclose them in a “Preserve Formatting” block. This tells Scrivener not to override or change the formatting for such passages during Compile. To do so, select the passage and go to Format &gt; Preserve Formatting. All other text (excepting text with styles applied) will have the default APA indentation assigned during the compilation process.
	•	Edit the “References” file so that it contains your bibliography, being careful to adhere to APA formatting requirements. (Please note that the dummy text in the “References” file is provided only as a rough example and not as an exemplar. Do not use it as the basis for your own references—instead, refer to the APA formatting guidelines online or as provided by your institution.)
	•	This template includes a “Footnotes” document which will be used to hold any footnotes you have created in the main body of the text. If you have not created any footnotes, you should either delete this document or deselect its “Include in Compile” setting in the Inspector or Compile panel.
	•	Create as many appendix documents as you require inside the “Appendices” folder, making sure that “Appendix” is set as the “Section Type” for each in the Inspector or “Contents” pane of the Compile panel.
	⁃	The title of each appendix document will be used as the appendix’s sub-heading during Compile.

Tables and Figures
If you need to use tables or figures in your manuscript, you can label them using the following tags, replacing “KEYWORD” with a unique word that identifies your table or figure.

!fig(KEYWORD)
!table(KEYWORD)

These tags will be replaced with numbers in the compiled document, with the numbering stream for figures being separate from the numbering stream for tables.

You can refer to such tags as follows:

#fig(KEYWORD)
#table(KEYWORD)

Here’s an example:

Table !table(sales): Sales 2011
Table !table(dates): Shipment dates
Figure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table #table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table #table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure #fig(skeleton))… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure #fig(malcolmreynolds)).

In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:

Table 1: Sales 2011
Table 2: Shipment dates
Figure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure 2: The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure 2).

Compiling
	•	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	•	Ensure “APA Format” is selected in the “Formats” sidebar.
	•	The first time you compile your paper, you will need to do a little set-up:
	⁃	Click on the gear button in the the right-most header bar of the Compile panel to open the Options pane.
	⁃	Fill in the title, abbreviated title and author information. The title will be used on the title page, and the abbreviated title will be used in page headers.
	⁃	Click on the “ab → ac” button to open the Replacements pane.
	⁃	Replace “School Name” in the “With” column with the name of your institution.
	⁃	Compile is set to use Times New Roman by default. If you require a different font, set the “Font” at the top of the “Section Layouts” pane.
	⁃	If you would rather your appendices did not have sub-headings, click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom-centre of the Compile panel and choose “Appendix” for the “Appendix” section type rather than “Appendix with Sub-Heading”.
	•	Click on “Compile” when everything is set up as you want.

            <Text>Each policy tool tackles different issues. Here will be shortly discussed which policy tool could work to handle the different externalities. 

Externalities related to strategic complementaries 
Short recap: a way to indicate this externality was by noticing rapid credit growth. Therefore a effective macroprudential policy tool would bring down the speed of growth. This can be done by several instruments. For one there are the capital requirements (De Nicolò et al 2012, Arregui et al 2013, Jeanne and Korinek 2014). Which include in the iMaPP database: risk weights, systemic risk buffers, and minimum capital requirements. Another instrument that can speed down the credit growth is the Countercyclical Buffer (CCB) (Jeanne and Korinek 2014). Also included are limits to the loan-to-value ratio and the debt-service-to-income (DSTI) (Jeanne and Korinek 2014, Arregui et al 2013, De Nicolò et al 2012). The iMaPP database hat also variables like: Limits on Credit Growth (LCG), Loan Restrictions (LoanR) and LeverageLimits (LVR) which also fits in this category.</Text>

            <Title>Paper Overview of Macroprudential Policy tools</Title>
            <Text>INTRODUCTION
- tool that where already established, wether micro prudential, monetary, fiscal or similar - even when they work in their own way- are not always enough to make sure of financial stability
- macroprudentials goal is it to reduce systemic risk that come from excessive financial procyclicality and from interconnectedness and  other cross-sectional factors
- one should use macro prudential policy because of externalities and market failures caused by various financial frictions and market imperfections that are there when micro prudential supervision and monetary policy are conducted efficiently 
- current macro prudential policy tools are mostly basted on micro prudential and regularity tools and additional macroprudential objectives have been added, like pigouvian taxes and levies
- in real estate markets cap on ltvs and debt service to income ratios seem to reduce booms  and therefore busts which are a big cause of instability 
- who should conduct macro prudential policies?
- macro prudential policies can interfere with the main goals of some agencies
-central bank may have a hard time communicating their monetary policy when they are also responsible for macroprudentail policy 
- a micro prudential authority may be less able to achieve their goals when they need multiple skill and are confronted with multiple (sometimes conflicting) goals

MOTIVATION
- recent global financial crisis
- showed interaction between macroeconomic and financial market developments (macro financial linkages)
- only externalities justify a macro prudential approach such as:  externalities that arise of strategic interactions of banks, externalities that relate to fire sales and credit crunches, externalities that relate to inerconcectedness
- these can be distinct between time series specific ones (give rise to procyclicality) and cross sectional specific ones that are due to interconnectedness
- externalities related to strategic complementaries: arise during the build-up of risk in a boom period
-financial intermediaries tend to assume exposures to common credit and liquidity risks in the upswing of a business cycle; this behaviour amplifies financial cycles and contributes to asset price volatility because strategic complementarities arise in market interactions between rational agents, meaning that the payoff of a certain strategy increases with the number of other agents undertaking the same strategy
- higher competition in boom times strengthens this effect
- in boom times, lower rents promoted by fiercer competition results in fewer incentives to screen potential borrowers
-Institutions have incentitive to continue risky lending, hide losses or copy each others behaviours in other way until the buildup of risks forces them to coordinate a strategy of loss recognition (poor performance is more accepted when others did the same)
- prospect of a bailout also can result in strategic complementarities, 
Externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches
- fire sales happens when an investor has to liquidate an asset at the same time when potential buyers are also struggling, so the price will be below its fundamental value
- so there will be a need to liquidate more assets which will trigger further losses
 -Fire sales and credit crunches are options for banks
- guarantees by central bank might reduce likelihood of doing such a thing but it is limited
- fire sales may trigger an external financial credit crunch, banks struggle and will cut back on their financing , borrowers have less access to finance and this worsens the real economy
-Risks are often built up in a boom
- Externalities related to interconnectedness
- banks and other financial institutions are interconnected, failure of one influence the other
- interconnects reduces small stocks and amplifies big ones
- sift = systemically important financial institutions —&gt; too big to fail (they want to become as important to receive a bailout)
Interactions with other policies and international dimensions
- macroprudential policies are not alone in being aimed at economic and financial stability
- others include monetary, micro prudential, fiscal and competition. Policies and macro prudential policy does interact with these policies 
Macro prudential and monetary policies
- both are good for countercyclical management
- monetary is mostly for price and economic stability while macro prudential is for financial stability 
- these policies interact so they may enhance or diminish the effectniss of the other 
- monetary policy alone cannot assure financial stability effectively or efficiently alone because its causes are not always related to interest rate level or the degree liquidity in the system (which monetary policy affects)
- also using macroprudentail policy primarily foe managing aggregate demand may create additional distortions by imposing constraints beyond where financial instability originates
- so monetary policy should focus on price stability and macroprudental policy on financial stability 
- but monetary policy affects financial stability (it affects leverage and short-term or foreign currency borrowing
- it is also possible for macro prudential policy to affect overall output by constraining borrowing and hence expenditures
- this shows that one needs to consider when conducting the policies that both ate affected 
-the case of the eurozone shows the economic (and financial) risks arise when booms are not (and cannot be) mitigated at a national level
- when the effective monetary stance gives rise to macroeconomic imbalances or excessively strong overall risk-taking incentives, macro prudential policies may be use, especially when other policies are imperfectly coordinated internationally (eg when foreign lenders are not constrained from lending to the country)
- macroeconomic risks need to be related to financial activities and when monetary arrangements are not adequate, strengthening monetary policy’s effectiveness will likely be better than using macroprudential policies as imperfect substitutes
- macro prudential policy also interacts with many other policies, like fiscal, micro prudential and other structural policies
Possible Macroprudential Tools and actual uses 
- most tools considered to date apply to the banking system xxx
- 3 goals of macroprudemtial policy: enhancing resilience, dampening the cycle and dispelling gestation of the cycle 
- 5 sets of corresponding rules: 1. quantitive restriction on borrowers, instruments or activities, 2. Capital and provisioning requirements, 3. Other quantitative restrictions on financial institutions’ balance sheets, 4. Taxation/ levies on activities or balance sheets, 5. Other more institutional-orientated measures
Actual Use of Macroprudential Policies
- in developed countries, LZV and DTI ratios are the most used, while other policies are rarely used there
- emerging markets use more policies and for longer than developed countries  and they favour more foreign exchange and liquidity-related policies(FC, RR), they also use CG limits more often
- devilled countries prefer the demand for credit-related LTV and DTI ratios, 
- before the financial crisis, emerging markets used these policies four time more intensively than did developed countries, with the ratio declining as developed countries started to use them
Research
Procyclicality
- LTV and DTI ratios, ceilings on credit growth, RR, DP rules can mitigate pro cyclicality
- capital requirements and RR significantly affect credit growth 
- LTV limits and capital requirements (but not RRs) strongly affect house pricing appreciation rates
- RRs reduce portfolio inflows in emerging markets with floating exchange rates
- no significant indication of asymmetric responses is found
-LTV ratios appear to impact overall output growth
- other research: policies such as maximum LTV ratios have the best change of curbing a real estate boom 
-IMF finds LTV tools are effective in reducing price shocks
