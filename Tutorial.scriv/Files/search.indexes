            <Title>Metadata</Title>
            <Text>Click on the third button in the inspector header bar, the one containing the tag icon, to open the Metadata pane.
Each document in Scrivener can be associated with different types of metadata. Which metadata you use, or whether you use it at all, is entirely up to you.
General Metadata
At the top of the Metadata pane is “General Metadata”. This contains the following:
	•	Created Date and Modified Date: the dates on which the current document was created and last edited.
	•	Include in Compile: if the document is inside the Draft folder, this checkbox determines whether the current document should be included as part of the final manuscript when compiled.
	•	Section Type: used by Compile to determine how to format the current document in the manuscript. We’ll look at section types when we come to Compile.
Custom Metadata
In the middle of the Metadata pane is “Custom Metadata”. By default, this pane is collapsed, but you can expand it by clicking either the “Custom Metadata” header bar or the disclosure triangle next to it.
Custom Metadata allows you to add your own checkboxes, pop-up menus, dates and text fields so that you can keep track of any information that doesn’t fit elsewhere.
You can set up custom metadata by going to Project &gt; Project Settings… or by clicking the # / # icon (depending on macOS version) at the top of the Custom Metadata area. Once you’ve done this, the custom metadata for each document can be viewed and edited either in the inspector or in the outliner.
Keywords
You can add arbitrary keywords to your documents to make searching for them easier, or to make keeping track of what is in a particular document easier. For example, you could add keywords for characters that occur in a scene, themes referenced or topics discussed.
To add a keyword: Click the “+” button in the Keywords header bar or hit enter while another keyword is selected.
You can also assign keywords via the keywords panel.
	1.	Click on the # / # icon icon in the “Keywords” header bar.
	2.	Select “Show Project Keywords”.
Alternatively, go to Project &gt; Show Project Keywords in the main menu.
Do so now. A panel appears showing all keywords in the project. Here you can create, organise and delete keywords, as well as search the project for selected keywords.
To change the colour associated with a keyword, double-click on its colour chip in the keywords panel.
Drag keywords from the panel to the inspector list to assign them to the current document, or drag and drop them onto documents in the binder, outliner or corkboard to assign them to selected documents there (you can assign keywords to multiple documents this way).
Try dragging the keyword entitled “Assign this one” from the keywords panel to the keywords list in the inspector now.
Okay, on to “Snapshots”.</Text>

            <Title>Scrivenings</Title>
            <Text>The whole point of Scrivener is to make working on a long text easier by allowing you to break it up into smaller pieces. Sometimes, however, you will want to see how those smaller pieces fit into the greater whole. This is where “Scrivenings” mode comes in.
There are two ways of entering Scrivenings mode:
	1.	Select a folder or group in the binder that contains text subdocuments and use Scrivenings mode to view all of the documents inside the folder as though they were a single text document. (Note that the text of the folder itself is also included at the top.)
	2.	Select multiple documents in the binder and use Scrivenings mode to view them as though they were a single document.
We already tried (1) when we were looking at “Editor View Modes”, so let’s try viewing multiple documents this time:
	1.	Click into the outliner in the top editor so that the top editor gets the focus (its header bar turning the system accent colour again).
	2.	Click on “START HERE” at the top of the binder.
	3.	With the Command key on the keyboard held down, click on “Editor View Modes” and “Scrivenings”, so that all three documents get selected.
	4.	Click on the Scrivenings mode icon in the view mode control in the toolbar (the leftmost icon in the control, showing the two pieces of paper). All three documents will now be loaded into the editor as a single text.
	5.	Click the scrivenings contents button that appears in the right of the header bar:  #
	6.	Select “Scrivenings” from the list that appears—the text will scroll down to this document.
	7.	Type something in the following line:
Type something here!
Take a look in the bottom editor—you’ll see the edits you made in scrivenings mode are reflected there, too.
Note: In Scrivenings mode, the inspector displays information about the section of text you are currently editing.
So that you can see where one document ends and the next begins, there is a dashed, horizontal dividing line between sections, but if you prefer you can also display the document titles above each section by selecting View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Show Titles in Scrivenings from the menu.
Tip: You cannot make textual edits across document boundaries. You can change formatting across boundaries though.
So, if you were writing a novel, you could write each scene of a chapter in isolation and then view and edit the whole chapter by selecting the chapter folder and entering Scrivenings mode.
We can get rid of the split now. To do so, click on the button in the right of the header bar for this editor:

That’s it for “Get Organised”—if you’re still with me, then by now you know almost everything you need to be productive with Scrivener. Next we’ll look at how you get your work out of Scrivener. Ensure the “Get It Out There” folder is expanded and then select “Section Types” in the binder.</Text>

            <Title>Section Types</Title>
            <Synopsis>How to tell Scrivener what the different sections in your manuscript are.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scrivener is designed to be flexible, allowing you to organise your writing however you want. You grow your manuscript in the Draft folder in sections as small or large as you like, using whatever structure you feel works best. When you are ready to get your manuscript out there for other people to read, you “compile” the contents of the Draft folder into a single exported or printed document.
Before we get to the Compile feature, however, we are presented with a problem: given that you can arrange your manuscript however you want, how can Scrivener know what each section is supposed to be, or how it should be formatted or arranged in the final manuscript? How can it know the difference between a title page and an introduction?
Or, suppose you decide to break up a novel by using a folder for each chapter, with text documents inside those folders each representing a scene. How does Scrivener know that your folders represent chapters and your text documents represent scenes?
The answer is that you tell Scrivener what each piece is using Section Types.
In the previous examples, you would:
	1.	Create section types in your project for “Title Page”, “Introduction”, “Chapter” and “Scene”.
	2.	Ensure each document has the appropriate section type applied.
	3.	When compiling, tell Scrivener how to format each section type (we’ll cover that in the next section).
Let’s see how section types work in practice:
	1.	Ensure the inspector is open and select the Metadata pane (the third button in the header bar, the one with the tag icon).
	2.	Under “General Metadata”, you will see a “Section type” pop-up menu.
	3.	Clicking on it, you will find the following options:
	⁃	Structure-based: Tells Scrivener that the current document should use the default section type based on its indentation in the binder (we’ll look at this in a moment).
	⁃	Project-specific types: “Heading” and “Text” are the only two section types specifically set up for this project—we’ll edit them in a moment.
	⁃	Edit: brings up the Project Settings panel so that we can edit the section types.
Note that this document’s section type is displayed as “Text” in grey italics. The grey italics indicate that this document is using the “Structure-based” setting, and that the default section type for the current document is “Text”. If we wanted, we could change it explicitly to “Heading” or “Text” using the pop-up menu.
Defining Section Types
The above is all a little abstract. It will make much more sense if we think about this in terms of the current binder and set up some custom section types ourselves. Take a look at the contents of the Draft folder in the binder:
	•	The three folders at the top level of the Draft folder are “The Basics”, “Going Further” and “Tips”—the three folders that use custom yellow icons (by “top level”, I mean the ones that are indented the least). The way I’ve organised this tutorial, each of these folders represents a major part of the Draft.
	•	The blue folders inside the three top-level folders—folders such as “Get Oriented”, “Get Organised” and so on—are essentially chapters.
	•	The text documents inside the blue folders each represent a different section inside a chapter.
So, the way I have organised the Draft for this tutorial is by parts, chapters and sections. Let’s set up the section types of this project to reflect that.
Tip: You can open these instructions in a separate window so that you can read them while the Project Settings panel is open by clicking on the yellow pencil button in the toolbar. This opens a “Quick Reference” window which you can place alongside the main project window. If there isn’t room on your screen for both windows, go to Window &gt; Float Quick Reference Panels. This will ensure the Quick Reference window floats over the top of the main project window.
	1.	In the main menu, go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and make sure “Section Types” is selected in the list on the left of the window that appears.
	2.	In the “Section Types” tab, double-click into “Heading” and change its title to “Part”.
	3.	Do the same for “Text”, renaming it to “Chapter”.
	4.	Click the “+” button to add a third section type and name it “Section”. (Note that you can drag and drop section types in this list to reorder them, but we’ll leave this order as-is.)
	5.	Click “OK”.
Now click on the section type pop-up menu in the inspector again. You’ll see that where before there were options for “Heading” and “Text”, there are now options for “Part”, “Chapter” and “Section”, which makes much more sense for our project.
Defining Default Section Types by Structure
There’s a problem, however: this document is shown as being a “Chapter” rather than a “Section”. One way we could fix this would be to override the setting manually. Try that now:
	1.	Click on the section type pop-up menu in the inspector.
	2.	Change the setting to “Section”.
Great! Except… It’s going to be a pain to change that setting for every single text document in the binder. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Let’s change it back again:
	1.	Once more, click on the section type pop-up.
	2.	Change the setting to “Structure-Based”. (It will change back to “Chapter” in italicised text.)
“Structure-Based” means: Use a default section type based on the indentation of this document in the binder. But how does Scrivener pick a section type based on indentation? That’s something you teach it in the Project Settings again:
	1.	Open the Project Settings from the main menu again.
	2.	This time, select the “Default Types by Structure” tab at the top. As soon as you do, you’ll notice that many folders in the binder are highlighted yellow.
	3.	Try clicking on the three rows—“All folders”, “All file groups” and “All files”. As you do so, different documents will be highlighted yellow in the binder.
The yellow highlights show which documents are affected by the selected setting. So, when you select “All folders”, all folders are highlighted yellow, for instance. Now let’s change the default settings:
	1.	Leave “All folders” as it is for now (so that the “Section Type” is set to “Part”).
	2.	Change the section type for “All file groups” to “Section”. (A file group is a text document containing other text documents.)
	3.	Change the section type for “All files” to “Section”.
	4.	Click “OK”.
We just told Scrivener that all folders are parts and all text documents are sections. If you look over in the inspector again, you’ll see that the section type for this document now correctly reads “Section”. If you click on any other text document, you’ll also see the section type set as “Section”. If you click on a folder, such as “The Basics” or “Get Oriented”, you’ll see the section type set as “Part”.
But wait, we don’t want all folders to be parts—only the top-level folders in the Draft (the ones using custom yellow icons) should be parts. The folders inside them (one level deeper) should be chapters. Let’s fix that:
	1.	Open Project Settings again.
	2.	Click on “All folders” to select it.
	3.	Click the “+” button (the one with two lines next to it).
	4.	Note how “All folders” changes to “Root folders” and another row is added entitled “Level 1 folders and deeper”.
	5.	Click the “+” button again.
	6.	A “Level 2 folders and deeper” row will be added.
	7.	Try selecting the different folder settings—“Root folders”, “Level 1 folders” and “Level 2 folders and deeper”—and take notice of what gets highlighted in the binder. You’ll see that the Draft folder is a “root folder”, the yellow folders are at “level 1”, and the folders using regular blue icons are at “level 2”.
	8.	Change the section type for “Level 2 folders and deeper” to “Chapter”.
	9.	Click “OK”.
Now try clicking on “The Basics” and “Get Oriented” in the binder again, taking note of the section type for each in the inspector, before returning here. Scrivener now knows how our binder is structured, and what each level represents. This means that, from now on, we’ll only need to change the section type in the inspector for the occasional document that we want to be different.
Note: When you create a new project based on one of the templates, such as the novel templates, the section types are all set up for you (although you now know how to edit them should you so wish).
These section types are going to come in handy when we compile the Draft, which is what we’ll move on to now…</Text>

            <Title>Label &amp; Status</Title>
            <Text>At the bottom of the inspector are the label and status pop-up buttons. (This document’s label is “Blue” and its status is “To Do”.)
Label and status are simply arbitrary tags that you can assign to a document. You set up the label and status tags you want to use in a project by going to Project &gt; Project Settings… You might, for example, rename “Label” to “POV” (for Point of View) and use it to record the name of the point-of-view characters in a novel, so that you can assign a character to each scene.
Status works much the same way, except that it is meant to keep track of the state of the document—for instance, “Finished”, “To do”, “A Mess” and so forth—although you can rename it and use it for anything you want. The only real difference between label and status is that labels have colours associated with them, and status items do not.
Tip: To assign a label or status to multiple documents, select several documents in the binder, Ctrl- or right-click on them, and select the label or status from the contextual menu that appears.
Next, click on “Bookmarks” in the binder.</Text>

            <Title>Copyholders</Title>
            <Text>In “The Basics”, we saw that you can split Scrivener’s editor in two to view two documents alongside one another. However, each of the two editors also has a “Copyholder” associated with it.
A Copyholder is a secondary editor that can be displayed inside an editor so that you can refer to another document. It is not a full editor in itself, in that it cannot display the corkboard, outliner or scrivenings modes; it can only show the content of a single document.
With two editors open each showing their Copyholders, you can view up to four documents in the main window at the same time.
Copyholders are opened by dragging a document to an editor header bar with the Option key held down, so let’s try that now:
	1.	Split the editor vertically (View &gt; Editor Layout &gt; Split Vertically).
	2.	Open another document in the right editor, e.g. by dragging any document from the binder to its header bar, or by clicking into the other editor and selecting another document in the binder.
	3.	Now pick another document and drag it to the right editor’s header bar, holding down Option on the keyboard when you drop it into the header. (Note that it’s best not to hold down Option until you drop; if you hold down Option when you start dragging, you may change what is shown in the other editor.)
The right editor will now be split in two, meaning there are now three documents being shown in the main window. Note how the Copyholder is not as detailed as the main editor—its header bar is narrow and it has no footer bar.
Tip: Ctrl-click on the Copyholder header bar to bring up a contextual menu that allows you to change the placement of the Copyholder.
To close a Copyholder, click on the “X” in the right of its header bar. Alternatively, click on the button left of the “X” to close the Copyholder and simultaneously open its document in a Quick Reference panel.</Text>

            <Title>Project Templates</Title>
            <Text>Scrivener comes with a range of project templates that can be used as the basis for new projects. To create a new project from a template:
	1.	From the main menu, choose File &gt; New Project…
	2.	In the templates chooser panel that appears, select a category in the sidebar.
	3.	Select one of the templates in the category.
	4.	Click “Choose…”
Note that the “Blank” project type is not technically a template. “Blank” creates an empty project that is not based on a template. I created all of the project templates (“Novel”, “Novel (with Parts)”, “Research Proposal”, “Comic Script” and so on) by starting from a blank project. For each one, I then added some extra folders with some custom icons, set up some document templates, changed a few project settings, and then saved the resulting project as a template which I then included with Scrivener.
You can create your own project templates in the same way. Here’s how:
	1.	Create a new project, either from the “Blank” template or from any other template (you might just want to customise one of the existing templates).
	⁃	Tip: When basing your template on an existing project template, hold down the Option key when clicking “Choose…” to create the project. This prevents Scrivener from auto-filling title pages and such with your name, address and other information.
	2.	Edit the project so that it contains all the elements and settings you want in new projects created from your template.
	3.	Select Save As Template… from the File menu.
	4.	From the “New Project Template” panel that appears, enter a title and description for the new template, choose a category and icon, then click on “OK”.
	5.	Go to File &gt; New Project… You will find the template you just created available as the basis for new projects. At this point you can delete the project from which you created the template, if you so wish.

            <Text>Now we’ll look at the “Comments &amp; Footnotes” pane—don’t worry about clicking on the button in the inspector header bar just yet, though.
Click on the yellow highlighted text in the sentence below:
This sentence has a comment attached.
Note how the inspector automatically switches to the Comments &amp; Footnotes pane, and the comment associated with the text gets highlighted.
Next, click on the grey footnote directly below the comment in the inspector.
This sentence has a footnote attached.
See how clicking on the note in the inspector automatically selects the text associated with it in the editor?
If you click on a note in the inspector, the editor automatically scrolls the text to where the note is located. Try scrolling to the bottom of this document, and then clicking the comment in the inspector to return to the top.
Tip: If the comments aren’t open in the inspector and you don’t want to show them, Opt-click or Cmd-click on a comment or footnote to open it in a popover instead of in the inspector.
Adding Comments and Footnotes
Let’s try adding some comments and footnotes of our own. First, select some of the text in the following sentence:
Select some of the text in this sentence.
Next, do one of the following:
	•	Click on the paperclip icon in the toolbar and select Add Comment from the menu that appears.
	•	Click the comment icon in the “Comments &amp; Footnotes” bar of the inspector.
	•	Go to Insert &gt; Comment in the main menu (or hit Shift-Cmd-8). A new comment will be created in the inspector ready for editing.
Then:
	•	Add some text.
	•	Hit the Escape key to return the focus to the editor.
You add footnotes in exactly the same way, but choosing Footnote in the menu or clicking the “cf” icon in the inspector.
Note: It doesn’t matter where you attach comments, but with footnotes you should always ensure that the footnote link (the grey highlight) ends at the place you want the footnote number to appear when printed or exported.
Changing the Colour of Comments
To change the colour of a comment:
	1.	Ctrl- or right-click on a comment in the inspector.
	2.	Select a colour from the menu that appears.
	3.	You can also hit Shift-Cmd-C (or go to Format &gt; Color in the main menu) to open the colour palette and choose a custom colour.
(You cannot change the colour of footnotes, which are differentiated from comments by all being grey.)
The contextual (Ctrl-click) menu also allows you to convert comments to footnotes and vice versa, and to revert comments and footnotes to use default formatting (which can be set in the “Editing” pane of the Preferences).
Tip: If you have a lot of comments, you can collapse individual comments and footnotes by clicking on the disclosure triangle (the downward-pointing arrow) in the top-left of each comment box.
Right, that’s the inspector covered! Now let’s take a look at composition mode. By now, you know the drill: click on “Composition Mode” in the binder.</Text>
            <Comments>Comments get displayed and selected as soon as they are clicked on in the main editor.
This is a footnote. For footnotes to be exported properly, it’s important to add them in such a way that the link ends exactly where you want the footnote to appear in the text.
You can choose a different colour for footnotes via the “Appearance” pane of Scrivener’s Preferences.</Comments>

            <Title>Styles</Title>
            <Text>Styles allow you to save and apply formatting to text. For example, you could create a “Block Quote” style with an indent and a smaller font than the rest of the text (Scrivener in fact provides a “Block Quote” style by default).
Scrivener remembers the style associated with a section of text. This way, if you change the formatting of a style, Scrivener can update all text that uses that style to use the new formatting.
Applying Styles
To apply a style, do one of the following:
	•	Select a style from the styles menu in the format bar—the styles menu is indicated by a pilcrow (¶)  and an “a”.
	•	Ctrl-click on the text and choose the style from the contextual menu that appears.
	•	Go to Format &gt; Style in the main menu and choose a style.
	•	Go to Format &gt; Style &gt; Show Styles Panel and choose a style from the panel that appears.
There are two types of style:
	1.	Paragraph Styles get applied to whole paragraphs, and include paragraph formatting such as line spacing and indents. They can optionally include character formatting such as italics and bold, and can also optionally affect the font family and size.
	⁃	Paragraph styles are indicated in menus by a pilcrow icon.
	⁃	Paragraph styles that also include character formatting are indicated by a pilcrow icon and an “a”.
	2.	Character Styles get applied only to the selected text or current word (if there is no selection). They only include character formatting such as italics and bold (and optionally the font family and size). They do not include paragraph formatting such as line spacing and indents.
	⁃	Character styles are indicated in menus by an “a”.
Tip: For body text, it’s generally best to use “No Style”. In Scrivener, unlike in many word processors, you should apply styles only to text that you want formatted differently from everything else. If you use styles for everything, even the main body text, then you will make it harder for Compile to override your formatting for different output requirements.
Creating Styles
To create a new style:
	1.	Create some text in the editor that uses the formatting you want to save as a style.
	2.	Select some of the text.
	3.	Go to Format &gt; Style &gt; New Style From Selection. A panel will appear.
	4.	Enter the name of the style.
	5.	Choose the style type:
	⁃	Save character attributes creates a character style.
	⁃	Save paragraph style creates a paragraph style that does not include character formatting.
	⁃	Save all formatting creates a paragraph style that includes character formatting.
	6.	Choose whether to include the font family and size.
	7.	Check the other options.
	8.	Click “OK”.
The style you created is now available for use in the style menus.
Redefining Styles
Sometimes you will want to tweak a style—maybe you realise you want your block quotes indented further, for instance. To do so, follow all the same steps as for creating styles above, except that instead of choosing New Style From Selection from the Style menu, choose Redefine Style From Selection.
Once again, go through the various options and click “OK”. (Note that when redefining a style, you cannot change a paragraph style to a character style or vice versa.) Upon hitting “OK”, a progress bar will appear while Scrivener goes through the entire project looking for text that uses this style, updating any found to use the redefined formatting.
Compiling Styles
Compile formats can be set up to override styles to use different formatting. Many of the Compile formats that are provided with Scrivener (such as “Manuscript (Times)” and “Paperback”) are set up to override the default styles such as “Block Quote”, “Body”, “Caption”, “Heading 1” and so on. You can create your own Compile formats that override styles, too.

	•	Restore an older version of your text by selecting the version you want from the list and clicking on Roll Back at the top (at which point, you will be given the option of taking another snapshot of your current version).
Note: You can immediately tell which documents have snapshots associated with them because their icons have dog-eared corners.
To see what’s changed in the document since the snapshot was taken, click on “Compare”. Try that now:
Type some text on the line below (anything you want):

Delete the text in the following line:
DELETE ME!
Now:
	•	In the inspector, select the snapshot you took a moment ago.
	•	Click “Compare”. See what happens?
	⁃	Text that has been added to the document since the snapshot was taken appears underlined and in blue.
	⁃	Text that has been deleted appears struck out and in red.
	⁃	Note that the comparison only shows textual changes—it does not show changes to the formatting.
	•	Click on the left and right arrows at the top of the inspector, between “Original” and “Roll Back”, to navigate between the changes.
Tip: You can alter the granularity (level of detail) of the comparison by clicking the # or #icon (depending on macOS version) to the right of “Compare” (which should now read “Original”, because clicking on it again will turn off the compare feature). Changing the granularity will give different results for different documents, depending on the scope of the edits. You will usually achieve the best results by leaving “By Paragraph” ticked but playing with “By Clause” and “By Word”.
You can also compare the differences between two snapshots by selecting them both in the list and clicking on Compare.
Let’s move on to “Comments &amp; Footnotes”.</Text>

            <Title>Quick Reference Panels</Title>
            <Text>As well as being able to split the editor to view more than one document, you can open documents in their own windows, allowing you to have as many documents in a project open on screen as you want. We call these windows “Quick Reference” panels, because you can use them to open, check and edit documents without affecting the main window.
Let’s start by opening this document in a Quick Reference panel so that we can keep it open while we open some others:
	1.	Click the “Quick Ref” icon in the toolbar (the one with the yellow pencil in it).
	2.	Resize the window that appears as you wish, so that you can still see the main window behind it.
You should now be reading this document inside the Quick Reference panel. You can change the label and status associated with a document using the pop-up buttons in the footer bar of the Quick Reference panel. You can also view the synopsis, notes and other metadata associated with the document using the pop-up button in the top-right of the window.
Next, in the main menu, select Window &gt; Float Quick Reference Panels. This makes it so that Quick Reference panels never disappear behind the main window. Now let’s look at some other ways of opening Quick Reference panels.
Space Bar
	1.	Click on “Sunset” in the “Research” folder of the binder.
	2.	Hit the space bar on the keyboard.
You should now have a second Quick Reference panel open, this one with an image in it.
Menu
Go to Navigate &gt; Open Quick Reference &gt; Research &gt; spacewalk_info.
You should now have a PDF file open in a separate window too.
Opening Multiple Panels at Once
Close all of Quick Reference panels you just opened. Once you’ve done that:
	1.	Holding down Command or Shift on the keyboard, select “Sunset” and “spacewalk_info” in the binder.
	2.	Drag both documents and drop them onto the “Quick Ref” (yellow pencil) button in the toolbar.
Both documents will reopen in Quick Reference windows. Dragging documents onto the toolbar icon allows you to open multiple items in Quick Reference panels at once.
Bookmarks
Clicking the bookmark icon in the left of the Quick Reference footer bar opens the project bookmarks in a sidebar. Clicking on documents in this sidebar opens them in the Quick Reference editor on the right of the panel.
You can therefore use Quick Reference panels as a way of referencing your project bookmarks in their own window.</Text>

            <Title>Multiple Books in One Project</Title>
            <Text>Generally, Scrivener is set up to assume that each project contains a single book (or writing project): when you compile, you compile the entire Draft folder into a single manuscript. However, you don’t have to work this way. Perhaps you are working on a series of books that rely on the same research, for instance—in that case, you might want to set up a project to contain multiple books. Here’s how:
	1.	Inside the Draft folder, setup a subfolder for each book.
	2.	Treat each subfolder inside the Draft folder as though it were the Draft folder for one of your books, creating your chapters for each book inside the book subfolder.
	3.	Adjust the section type settings under “Default Types by Structure” in Project Settings as necessary, so that they correctly reflect the updated structure.
Then, when you want to compile one of the books:
	1.	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	2.	Above the list of documents on the right side of the Compile panel, click on the pop-up menu next to where it says “Compile” (this pop-up normally shows the name of your Draft folder).
	3.	Select the folder containing the book you wish to compile.
	4.	Tick “Treat compile group as complete manuscript”. This tells Scrivener that the folder you are compiling should be treated as though it is a complete book and not part of a larger draft.
	5.	Ensure “Include text of containing group” is not ticked.

            <Title>The Binder</Title>
            <Text>Using the Binder
The binder is the main navigation tool in Scrivener. You use it to access different parts of your project, as well as to create new sections and arrange them. (Note: we refer to each section in the binder as a “document”, but each document can contain as much or as little text as you like.)
The basics are simple:
	•	Click on a document to open it in the editor.
	•	Click on the triangle next to a folder or group to show or hide (expand or collapse) its contents (subdocuments).
	•	Drag and drop documents to rearrange them.
	•	Double-click on a document to rename it.
	•	Click “+” in the footer at the bottom of the binder (or in the toolbar) to create a new document. (Cmd-N)
	•	To create a new folder, click the button containing a folder with a “+” inside it at the bottom of the binder, or click the down arrow next to the “+” button in the toolbar. (Opt-Cmd-N)
	•	You can also add new documents from the Project menu or by hitting enter when a document is selected and the binder has the focus.
	•	Import files into Scrivener by dragging them from the Finder into Scrivener’s binder. Alternatively, use File &gt; Import &gt; Files… in Scrivener’s main menu at the top of the screen.
Special Folders
Along with anything else you add, the binder always contains three special folders that cannot be removed:
	1.	The Draft folder. Anything you want to be part of your finished manuscript should be placed inside this folder. Its contents will be compiled into a single document when you export or print using File &gt; Compile… Because the Draft folder is used for building your manuscript, it is unique in that it can only hold text files—you cannot import image or research files into this folder.
	⁃	Tip: If you want an image in the text of your manuscript, place the cursor inside a text document in the Draft and use Insert &gt; Image From File… to insert the image into the text.
	⁃	Note: All folders and files can be renamed, even the special folders. In some of Scrivener’s project templates, the Draft folder has a different name, such as “Manuscript”.
	2.	The Research folder can hold text or media files (images, PDF files, video files and more), and is the default storage location for research materials not intended for inclusion in the final manuscript. You don’t have to put all your research files into the Research folder, though—you can create other folders for your support materials anywhere you want.
	3.	Whenever you delete a document, it ends up in the Trash folder. Documents are not deleted forever until you select Empty Trash… from the Project menu.
There’s Nothing Special About Other Folders
In Scrivener, there’s no real difference between folders (excepting the three special folders) and text files. A folder is just a special kind of text file that has a different icon and opens in a different editor view mode by default (we’ll get to view modes shortly).
You can convert a folder document to a text document and vice versa easily. Try this now:
	•	Ctrl-click (or right-click) on “Get Oriented” in the binder (directly beneath the yellow “The Basics” folder).
	•	From the contextual menu that appears, select Convert to File. Note how the folder icon becomes a text stack icon.
	•	Ctrl-click (or right-click) on “Get Oriented” again. You’ll see that the option is now Convert to Folder—click it to convert back. (You can also convert from the Documents menu.)
So, whether you prefer to use folders or text groups is entirely up to you, and you can convert between them at any time. (Note: A text or file group is any non-folder that has subdocuments.)
Searching
To search for documents in the project:
	1.	Click on the magnifying glass in the toolbar. A search field will appear at the top of the binder.
	2.	Enter text in the search field. The binder will be replaced with a purple search results list.
	⁃	Tip: Click on the magnifying glass icon in the left of the search field to change search options.
	3.	Click on the “X” in the left of the search results header bar to return to the binder, or click on the magnifying glass in the toolbar again.
#

	4.	Click on the magnifying glass in the toolbar to hide the search field if it is still visible.
You can also run a quick search for documents using Quick Search field in the toolbar (which currently shows “The Binder”, the current document name). This works like the search field in Safari and brings up a menu of the top results. This is great when you know the title of the document you want to find.
Now let’s take a look at the editor—click on “The Editor” in the binder.</Text>

            <Title>The Inspector</Title>
            <Text>Click the blue “i” icon on the right of the toolbar to open the inspector. The inspector will appear as a third pane on the right of the window, and it shows extra information associated with the document that you have open in the editor.
At the top of the inspector you will see these buttons:
#

These buttons change what is displayed in the inspector. From left to right, they are:
	•	Notes: The document synopsis and notes.
	•	Bookmarks: Bookmarks associated with the document and project.
	•	Metadata: Various metadata relating to the document.
	•	Snapshots: Snapshots you have taken of the document. (Snapshots are older versions of the document.)
	•	Comments &amp; Footnotes: Comments and footnotes associated with the text in the editor.
The buttons available will change depending on what sort of document is shown in the editor. For instance, “Snapshots” and “Comments &amp; Footnotes” are only available for text documents.
A dot in the corner of one of these buttons indicates that there is content in the associated pane.
Let’s start by clicking on the Notes button. Once you’ve done that, select “Synopsis &amp; Notes” in the binder.</Text>

            <Title>Exporting Files</Title>
            <Text>There are three ways of getting work out in Scrivener:
	1.	Compile the Draft folder into a single document for printing or exporting.
	2.	Print the contents of the current editor using File &gt; Print Current Document…
	3.	Export individual documents from the binder—this is what we will look at here.
Exporting allows you to get anything you have brought into Scrivener out again, or to export individual text files to popular word processor formats. To export:
	1.	In the binder, select all of the files you want to export.
	2.	From the main menu, select File &gt; Export &gt; Files…
	3.	If multiple files were selected, you will be prompted to enter the name of a directory that will be created in the Finder to hold the files.
	4.	Choose your preferred text file format from the pop-up menu next to “Export text files as”.
	⁃	Note: This option is available even if you are only exporting image or media files. In that case, it only has any effect if you choose to export the notes associated with such files too.
	5.	Go through the “Metadata” and “Options” settings.
	6.	Click “Export”.
The selected files will be exported with the binder structure intact—folders in the binder will become folders in the Finder.</Text>

            <Title>Compiling the Draft</Title>
            <Synopsis>How to take all of the pieces of your manuscript and compile them into a single exported or printed document.</Synopsis>
            <Text>We’ve seen that one of the key concepts of Scrivener is that you work on your manuscript in pieces, but this wouldn’t be much use if you couldn’t put Humpty together again. That’s where Compile comes in: you write your manuscript in the Draft folder, and when you’re ready to share it with the world, you “compile” it into a single file. Compiling doesn’t affect the original documents inside Scrivener—they all stay as they were in the Draft folder—it simply copies them into a combined text in the form of an e-book, a PDF file, a Word file, a print-out, or whatever format you choose.
Note: This section covers compiling your documents into a single file for export or print. You can also export or print individual documents separately using File &gt; Print Current Document… or File &gt; Export &gt; Files…
Let’s try compiling the tutorial:
	1.	From the main menu, select File &gt; Compile…
	2.	Make sure “Default” is selected under “Formats” on the left and “Print” is selected next to “Compile for” at the top.
	3.	Click “Compile”.
	4.	In the print panel that appears, click on the “PDF” button in the lower-left and select Open PDF in Preview.
A PDF document will open in Preview. Scroll through it, and you will see that it contains everything you have read so far and more—everything in the Draft folder compiled into a single text.
Using Compile Formats
In the PDF we just produced, the text looks exactly the same as it does in Scrivener’s editor. What if you need to generate a manuscript using standard formatting (e.g. Courier 12-point) to send to your editor, though? Or what if you want to create a paperback for self-publishing?
With traditional word processors, you would need to go through and reformat your entire manuscript for every format you wanted to create—changing the font and paragraph settings and so on. In Scrivener, there’s no need for any of that. You write using whatever font and format you like looking at on the screen, and then you tell Compile to change the formatting in the final document. You do this by choosing a Compile Format from the list on the left of the Compile panel.
Let’s compile the tutorial into standard manuscript format, then:
	1.	Go to File &gt; Compile… again.
	2.	This time, select “Manuscript (Courier)” in the “Formats” list.
	3.	Click “Compile” and again choose to open the PDF in Preview.
Huh. Other than a header at the top of the page, that doesn’t look any different from before—why?
Remember how in the last section we looked at “section types”? We told Scrivener what all the different parts of our Draft folder were (in the case of this tutorial, parts, chapters and sections). Well, now we have to tell Scrivener how to lay out each of those section types.
	•	Each Compile format consists of a number of “section layouts”.
	•	Each section layout defines a number of settings that can be applied to a document in the Draft, such as whether the font face and size should be changed, whether there should be a page break before it, and so on.
	•	You apply a section layout to each section type in your project to tell Scrivener how to format your manuscript.
Let’s tell Scrivener how to format the parts, chapters and sections in our tutorial:
Tip: You can open these instructions in a separate window so that you can read them while the Compile panel is open by clicking on the yellow pencil button in the toolbar. This opens a “Quick Reference” window which you can place alongside the main project window. If there isn’t room on your screen for both windows, go to Window &gt; Float Quick Reference Panels. This will ensure the Quick Reference window floats over the top of the main project window.
	1.	Open Compile again. (Note that “Manuscript (Courier)” will still be selected.)
	2.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the central “Section Layouts” area.
	⁃	A window will appear. On the left is a list of the section types defined in the project (“Part”, “Chapter” and “Section”); on the right is a list of section layouts defined in the current Compile format, along with a preview of how each section layout will make your text look.
	3.	Select “Part” in the list on the left.
	4.	Select the “Part Title” section layout on the right.
	⁃	You have just told Scrivener that, when using the “Manuscript (Courier)” Compile format, documents or folders in this project that have the “Part” section type applied should use the “Part Title” section layout during Compile.
	5.	Select “Chapter” on the left.
	6.	Select the “Chapter Title” section layout on the right.
	7.	Select “Section” on the left.
	8.	Select “Section Text” on the right.
	9.	Click “OK”.
	10.	Click “Compile”, and again open the results in Preview.
You will now see that the font and formatting throughout the document has been altered—it now uses Courier 12-point and parts and chapters start on a new page with a title at the top.
Choose different Compile formats to apply different formatting—for instance, the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format will create a manuscript suitable for submitting to Amazon KDP.
Note: You can compile to many different file formats (e.g. Word, e-book) by changing the “Compile for” setting at the top of the Compile panel. Which Compile formats are available will depend on the file format selected.
Compile Settings
	•	On the right of the Compile panel is a list of the documents that will be compiled. Here you can un-tick any documents you don’t want included and change the section types.
	•	Other options are available by clicking on the buttons in the header bar above the contents list. The options available vary according to the selected file format.
	•	At the bottom of the contents list are options for adding front and back matter. Here you can select a folder contained outside of the Draft folder, the contents of which will be added either to the front or back of the manuscript. These settings are saved per-Compile format, so that you can have different front and back matter for different formats.
	⁃	The lock button next to these options locks the front or back matter folder to the current file format (as selected next to “Compile for”). You won’t normally need to use this, unless you want different front and back matter settings for different file formats when using the same Compile format. (For instance, you might want different front matter for the ePub and PDF versions of your book.)
	•	You can override the font used throughout by using the “Font” pop-up menu at the top of the “Section Layouts” area.
Tip: If you hold down the Option key on your keyboard, the “Compile” button in the Compile panel changes to “Save”, allowing you to save the settings without compiling.
Creating Your Own Compile Formats
Scrivener comes with a number of Compile formats built-in. If they don’t provide what you need, you can create your own, as follows:
	1.	Click on the “+” button below the Formats list.
	2.	If you want to create a new format from scratch, select “New Format…”.
	3.	If you want to base your new format on an existing one, select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”.
At this point, the entire window changes to present you with a wealth of options. Here you can name the format, choose where to save it, create your own section layouts, determine the size of the printed page, set up page headers and footers, override styles, and much, much more. You have complete control over how your work will look when compiled.
The # / # button (depending on macOS version) above the list on the left allows you to set the file formats that will work with your Compile format. The “Test…” button allows you to test your settings.
We won’t go into all the details of creating your own Compile format here—the chances are that you will never need to create your own format and will only use the formats built into Scrivener. For now, it’s only important to know that you can create your own formats if you ever need to. Refer to the user manual (available from the Help menu) if you ever decide to get your fingers dirty (or just experiment—you can’t break anything!).
Okay, we’re about done. Select “Creating a New Project” under “Get Going” (expanding the latter if necessary).</Text>

            <Title>Inline Notes</Title>
            <Text>When covering “The Basics”, we saw how we could add comments and footnotes to text that are displayed in the inspector. Another way of adding footnotes and comments is to insert them inline. The text of inline annotations and footnotes appears right inside your text (as opposed to inspector comments and footnotes, the text of which is hidden away in the inspector).
Whether you use inspector or inline footnotes and comments is entirely up to you (you can even use a mixture of both).
Inline footnotes and annotations look like this:
This text has a footnote after it. This is a footnote. When the text is compiled, exported or printed, this footnote will be turned into a “real” footnote (or endnote).
And this is an annotation. Annotations can be completely removed from the text when you compile, print or export.
To create an inline note:
	1.	Select the text you wish to turn into a footnote or annotation.
	2.	Go to Insert &gt; Inline Footnote or Insert &gt; Inline Annotation in the menu.
You can also choose one of these options with no selection and then start typing.
You can change the colour of an annotation by clicking into it and using the Format &gt; Color… panel or the format bar colour button.
When you export your work, ranges of text defined as footnotes can be turned into end-of-page footnotes, and ranges of text defined as annotations can be turned into comments or omitted altogether.
Note: When creating inline footnotes, the grey bubble should start exactly where you want the footnote marker to appear in the printed or exported text.

Welcome to the Tutorial
Welcome to Scrivener! This tutorial is a Scrivener project, just like the ones you’ll create for your own writing. It will introduce you to all the main features of the software by getting you to use them. Once you’ve finished the tutorial, go to File &gt; New Project to begin your own project.
Feel free to experiment and edit this tutorial as you go. If at any time you decide you want to restore the tutorial to its original state, follow the instructions in “Resetting the Tutorial”, which you will find inside the “Tips” section in the sidebar (click on the triangle next to the lightbulb icon to view the tips).
How to Use This Tutorial
This tutorial is divided into three main sections, each indicated by a yellow icon in the sidebar.
	1.	The Basics covers everything you need to know to start using Scrivener. You should read it in order, and it should take just over an hour to go through. Once you’ve been through this section, you’ll know everything you need to know to create your own projects and use Scrivener efficiently.
	2.	Going Further covers various useful tools and features in a little more depth. It is designed for dipping into, so you don’t need to read it in order. Whenever you feel like learning more, open up the tutorial and browse through the list of subjects in this section.
	3.	Tips contains (you guessed it) a selection of short tips. As with “Going Further”, dip into this section whenever you feel like it.
If you’re new to Scrivener, therefore, work your way through “The Basics” and then create your own project and get writing. When you’re feeling at home, come back and explore “Going Further” and “Tips” (to what I believe the kids call “level up”).
Note to Scrivener 2 users: If you’re not new to Scrivener and previously used Scrivener 2, check out the “What’s New in Scrivener 3” collection (click on the new “View” button, leftmost in the toolbar, and select Show Collections to open the collections area).
Some Tips Before You Begin
	•	Scrivener contains many powerful tools, but you don’t have to use (or even know about) them all. Just use what’s useful to you and don’t worry about the rest. Once you know the basics, you can look into other features when you feel you need them.
	•	If the text is a little small for your liking, change the text zoom by going to View &gt; Zoom or using the percentage button below the text.
	•	You might find it helpful to turn on toolbar titles while going through the tutorial. To do so, Ctrl-click anywhere on the toolbar (the band of icons at the very top of the window) and select “Icon and Text” from the menu that appears.
	•	This tutorial assumes that you are using the default preferences. If necessary, you can reset them to the defaults by clicking on the “Defaults” button in the Preferences pane, available under Scrivener &gt; Preferences…
Before diving into the tutorial proper, click on “Key Concepts” in the list on the left to get familiar with the core ideas behind Scrivener.</Text>

            <Title>Corkboard and Outliner Tricks</Title>

            <Title>The Corkboard</Title>
            <Text>The corkboard shows the immediate subdocuments of the selected document. To see this in action:
	1.	Split the editor again by going to View &gt; Editor Layout &gt; Split Horizontally (or using the button in the editor header view).
	2.	Click into the top editor so that its header view changes colour (to indicate that it has the focus).
	3.	Click on the “Draft” folder in the binder to load it in the top editor.
	4.	Make sure the corkboard is selected in the view mode control in the toolbar.
Note how the corkboard in the top editor now shows the three folders, “The Basics”, “Going Further” and “Tips”, represented as index cards. If you look in the binder, you will notice that these three folders are the immediate subdocuments of the Draft folder—that is, they are only indented one level deeper than the Draft folder.
Note: Index cards on the corkboard show the title and synopsis of each document. If a document does not have a synopsis associated with it, the first lines of its text will be displayed in grey instead.
Next, in the corkboard, double-click on the yellow book icon in the second card. This will drill down to show the contents of the “Going Further” folder on the corkboard.
You can edit the synopsis or title in a card by double-clicking into it, and you can drag the cards around (and into the binder) to reorder your documents. (If you try this out in the tutorial, be sure to put them back into their original order afterwards!)
Now click on the “Research” folder in the binder. Note how media files such as images are displayed as photographs on the corkboard rather than as index cards (although you can change this behaviour via the Preferences).
Tip: If the inspector is open, it will show information for the currently selected document in the corkboard (or outliner). If nothing is selected, information will be shown for the container document.
Corkboard Options
You can change settings such as the number of cards in a row and their width by clicking on the button showing an icon of four index cards in the right of the footer bar:
#

	•	Other view options are available from the View &gt; Corkboard Options menu.
	•	Show status stamps on cards (diagonal stamps indicating the status of each document) by going to View &gt; Corkboard Options &gt; Show Status Stamps.
	•	Tint cards with label colours by going to View &gt; Use Label Color In &gt; Index Cards.
	•	Ctrl-clicking on selected cards brings up a contextual menu, allowing you to change the label and status of the documents associated with those cards.
There’s a whole lot more you can do with the corkboard, so once you feel at home in Scrivener, be sure to come back and check out the corkboard section in “Going Further” (or have a look at the full user manual available from the Help menu).
For now, though (after a stretch of the legs, a glass of wine, a good curse at the prolixity of this tutorial’s author, whichever helps), let’s move on to the outliner. To do so, make sure the focus is in the bottom editor (by clicking into it if necessary), and then select “The Outliner” in the binder.</Text>

	1.	Draft target: the total number of words, characters or pages you wish to write in your manuscript.
	2.	Session target: the number of words or characters you wish to write during the current writing session.
	3.	Document target: the number of words or characters you wish to write in a particular document.
Draft Target
Anything you type in documents inside the Draft folder counts towards the Draft target. To set it:
	1.	Go to Project &gt; Show Project Targets.
	2.	Click into the number after “of” beneath the first progress bar.
	3.	Type the target count.
	4.	Click onto “words” next to the number and choose “words”, “chars” or “pages”.
Session Target
To set it a session target:
	1.	Go to Project &gt; Show Project Targets.
	2.	Click into the number after “of” beneath the second progress bar.
	3.	Type the target count.
	4.	Click onto “words” next to the number and choose “words” or “chars”.
	5.	Click on “Options…”.
	6.	Click on the “Session Target” tab and go through the options.
	⁃	“Reset session count” allows you to choose to have the session count reset at a particular time every day.
	⁃	If “Count text written anywhere in the project” is ticked, the session count will increase even when typing in documents outside the Draft folder, that are not part of your final manuscript.
	⁃	You can also choose to have session targets automatically calculated by setting a deadline date for the Draft target in the “Draft Target” tab and then ticking “Automatically calculate from draft deadline” in the “Session Target” tab.  When these options are selected, you can also tell Scrivener on which days of the week you write, so that it can adjust the daily session target accordingly.
	7.	Click “OK”.
Viewing the Draft and Session Targets
When a Draft or session target is set, a progress bar appears in the search field in Scrivener’s toolbar. If both a Draft and a session target is set, the Draft progress bar will appear at the top of the search field and the session progress bar will appear at the bottom; if only one target is set, it will appear at the bottom.
Moving the mouse over the search field shows the current Draft and session count.
You can also go to Project &gt; Show Project Targets… to view the targets in the floating panel.
Document Targets
To set a document target:
	1.	In the footer view of a text document, click on the target icon.
	2.	Set a target in the panel that appears.
The target button in the footer view will be replaced with a progress bar showing the current progress for the document. You can click on the progress bar to edit or remove the target.</Text>

            <Text>Composition mode blocks everything else out so that it’s just you and your words. To enter composition mode, try one of the following:
	•	Click on the square, grey icon next to the blue inspector icon in the toolbar.
	•	Hit Opt-Cmd-F on the keyboard.
	•	Go to View &gt; Enter Composition Mode.
You will now be looking at nothing but your text. (When first entering composition mode, you’ll see a message about typewriter scrolling—if you would like to learn more about that feature, see the “Typewriter Scrolling” bookmark in the inspector.)
Here’s what you need to know about composition mode:
	•	When you move the mouse to the bottom of the screen, a control bar appears. This allows you to change the text zoom, the position and width of the virtual paper, and fade the background in and out. It also has buttons to bring up the keywords panel and inspector.
	⁃	Tip: Holding down the Option key while the control bar is visible changes the “Paper Width” slider to “Paper Height”.
	•	You can customise the look of composition mode in the “Appearance” pane of the Preferences. By default, the regular text colour is overridden to appear as white on a dark grey-blue background, but you can change this to use black-on-white, green-on-black or anything you want.
	•	You can set a background image for composition mode via Project &gt; Project Settings…
	•	Switch documents in composition mode by going to Navigate &gt; Go To in the main menu, or by using the “Go To” button in the control bar. (Also, the keyboard shortcuts Opt-Cmd-Up and Opt-Cmd-Down navigate to the previous and next document in the binder, and Cmd-[ and Cmd-] navigate back and forth through the document history.)
	•	Hit Opt-Cmd-F or Escape to leave composition mode (or use the button on the right in the control bar).
Okay, let’s leave composition mode now (hit Escape).
Your orientation is now complete! Let’s move on to the organisation tools. To access the next section, we’re going to do something a little different—be sure to read all of the instructions below before following them:
	1.	Click on the “Get Organised” folder. Upon so doing, this editor will be replaced by the corkboard—a number of index cards against a light brown background.
	2.	Once the corkboard appears, in the toolbar, click on the corkboard icon (the centre icon in the group of three next to the search field) to turn it off. Once you’ve done that, the corkboard in the editor should be replaced with text, and the control in the toolbar should look like this, with no section selected:

orbiter mission, and consumables are provided for three two-person, 6-hour EVAs. Two EVAs are available for payload use, with the third reserved for orbiter contingency operations. EVA has been demonstrated to be useful in satellite repair, retrieval, and refueling as well as with space station development.
There are three basic categories of EVA: scheduled, unscheduled, and contingency . A scheduled EVA is defined as any EVA incorpo- rated into the nominal flight plan in order to complete a specific mission objective. An unscheduled EVA is not part of the flight plan; rather, it is conducted to achieve payload opera- tion success or to advance overall mission accomplishments. A contingency EV A is also unscheduled, but is required to ensure safe return of the orbiter and flight crew.
A subcategory of scheduled EVA is the quick- response EV A. A quick-response EV A must be performed within a few hours after a problem is discovered, and it is usually associated with payload deployment. Quick-response EVAs are planned pre-flight, and the crew prepares for the EVA even though it may not be performed.

                     Description
An EVA occurs when a crewmember leaves the protective environment of a spacecraft's pres- surized cabin and ventures out into the vacuum of space wearing a space suit. An EVA is com- monly referred to as a spacewalk. The current space suit, designed for a total maximum dura- tion of 7 hours, provides environmental protec- tion, mobility, life support, and communica- tions. Two suits are included in each baseline

  Space Shuttle EVA Chronology
  Extravehicular activities are classified according to level of complexity: simple, intermediate, or complex. A simple payload EVA requires mini- mal unique tools, mockups, or mobility aids. Existing procedures and techniques may be adapted to particular EVA needs, thus requiring minimal crew training. An intermediate pay- load EVA requires development of new tools and equipment. Some procedure and technique development is required, with more extensive training necessary . A complex payload EV A requires the design and development of com- plex or elaborate tools and equipment. The tasks require extension of basic capabilities and
may pose difficulty in access or restraint. Proce- dure and technique development is extensive, as are crew training requirements.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit
The extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) is an independent anthropomorphic system that pro- vides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and communications for the crewmem- ber to perform EVA in Earth orbit. For EMU design considerations, an EVA is defined as any time the EMU external environmental pressure is below 4.0 psia. The EMU is designed to
Extravehicular Mobility Unit
 accommodate an EVA mission with a total maximum duration of 7 hours, consisting of 15 minutes for egress, 6 hours for useful EVA tasks, 15 minutes for ingress, and a 30-minute reserve. The EMU also accommodates specific metabolic rate limits, including (1) an average metabolic rate not exceeding 1600 Btu/hr in any given EVA hour and not exceeding 1000 Btu/hr for the entire duration, (2) a peak metabolic rate not exceeding 2000 Btu/hr for a period of 15 minutes, and (3) a minimum metabolic rate not less than 400 Btu/hr for a period of 30 minutes. The EMU is an integrated assembly, primarily composed of the space suit assembly, life support system, and numerous items of associ- ated support and ancillary equipment.
Space Suit Assembly
The space suit assembly (SSA) is the anthro- pomorphic pressure vessel that encloses the crewmember's torso, limbs, and head. The SSA provides a variety of functions while the crewmember performs an EV A, including suit pressure retention, crewmember mobility, crew- member liquid cooling distribution, oxygen ventilation gas circulation, downlink of crew- member's electrocardiogram data via EMU radio, crewmember interface with EMU radio, crewmember in-suit drinking water, and urine containment. The SSA operates under specific pressure requirements and leakage criteria.
The space suit assembly consists of the following:
  Hard upper torso/arms
  Lower torso assembly
  Extravehicular gloves
  Helmet/extravehicular visor assembly
  Liquid cooling and ventilation garment
  Operational bioinstrumentation system
  Communications carrier assembly
  In-suit drink bag
  Urine collection device
  Maximum absorption garment.
The hard upper torso (HUT) provides pressure containment for the upper torso as well as being the central component from which the mechani- cal, electrical, and fluid interfaces of the EMU branch. The HUT is available in four sizes to accommodate 5th through 95th percentile-sized crewmembers. The planar HUT, which deletes the arm gimbal and bellows assembly, will be available in two sizes. The HUT includes the following components: fiberglass shell (with water tubes and oxygen ducts), assorted mounting brackets, waterline and vent tube assembly, multiple water connector, EMU electrical harness, shoulder bearing assemblies, waist disconnect ring (passive half), helmet disconnect ring, and thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG). The right and left arm assem- blies are flexible, anthropomorphic pressure vessels that encompass the arms. Each arm assembly includes the following components: upper arm assembly, rotating scye bearing, lower arm assembly, rotating arm bearing, wrist disconnect ring, urethane pressure bladders, cloth restraint systems, and TMGs for the upper and lower arm assemblies.
The lower torso assembly (LTA) consists of a flexible anthropomorphic pressure vessel that encompasses the waist, lower torso, legs, and feet. The L T A includes the following compo- nents: waist assembly, waist disconnect ring, trouser assembly, rotating waist bearing between the waist and trouser assemblies, boot assembly, urethane pressure bladders, cloth restraint systems, and TMGs for the waist, trouser, and boot assemblies.
The current sizing of the arm/leg assemblies is accomplished on the ground using different sizes of each assembly for a particular crew- member. An enhanced EMU has been devel- oped to provide an on-orbit capability of EMU resizing by using various arm/leg segments and sizing rings. The on-orbit quick-sizing capabil- ity, uses threaded quick-disconnects, softgood sizing elements, aluminum sizing rings, and adjustable-length restraint lines. This suit incor- porates dual lip seal mobility bearings and low- torque fabric joints. The enhanced EMU will phase out the current space suit for future station and shuttle operations.
   SSA Arm Assembly
Lower Torso Assembly with TMG Removed
 The extravehicular gloves consist of a detach- able, flexible pressure vessel, encompassing each hand for use during EVA. The extrave- hicular gloves include the following compo- nents: urethane pressure bladder and cloth restraint system, wrist disconnect ring with rotating wrist bearing, wrist gimbal ring, adjustable palm restraint bar/strap, wrist tether strap, and TMG with palm restraint bar. The current 4000 series gloves incorporate a stan- dard nine-size system to size the gloves for a comfortable fit. The glove fingers use a sizing feature that consists of a pair of polyester dacron cords to provide finger length adjust- ments. Customized gloves can be manufactured for the crewmember if a proper fit cannot be obtained from the standard size glove.
Enhanced Arm Assembly
The helmet, a "one-size-fits-all" model, consists of a detachable, transparent, hard pressure vessel encompassing the head. The helmet includes the following components: hard trans- parent bubble, helmet disconnect ring, helmet purge valve, and vent pad. Two crew optional items are also available for the helmet. One of these items is the Fresnel lens, which is mounted to the lower front inside of the helmet to improve display control module visibility for the crewmember. The other item is the valsalva device, attached to the inside of the bubble, which allows the crewmember to clear his or her ears during pressure changes. The extravehicu- lar visor assembly (EVVA) attaches to the helmet to provide the crewmember with visual,
thermal, impact, and micrometeoroid protec- tion. The EVVA includes the following compo- nents: clear protective visor, sun visor, center and side eyeshades, fiberglass shell, and latch mechanisms and supporting structure for the visor and eyeshades.
Enhanced Lower Torso Assembly
The liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) is a form-fitting elastic garment worn against the crewmember's body. The LCVG includes the following components: outer restraint fabric, inner liner assembly, crew optional comfort pads, biomed pocket, dosime- ter pocket, water tubing network, paramanifold assembly, ventilation ducting network, vent plenum assembly, multiple water connector, and full torso zipper. The garment supports a network of tubing that circulates water over the body to provide cooling to the crewmember. It also supports a network of ducting that draws ventilation gas from the suit extremities and routes it back to the primary life support system to complete the suit ventilation loop. Connec- tions to the ducting in the HUT for both cooling water and ventilation flow are made at the LCVG half of the multiple water connector. The LCVG is sized to fit the crewmember based on a sizing system with six size ranges.
  
 The communications carrier assembly (CCA) is a cloth aviator-type cap that positions and supports the electronics for interface with the EMU radio for crewmember communications. The CCA contains the microphones and ear- phones necessary for the EVA crewmembers to communicate with each other or with the orbiter. The CCA also allows the EVA crew- members to talk to Mission Control via the orbiter communications system. Six sizes allow the CCA to fit 5th through 95th percentile-sized crewmembers. The CCA includes the following components: skull cap, ear cups, ear phones, ear seals, microphone modules, microphone booms, summing module, interconnect wiring, interface cable, neck strap, crew-optional chin strap, and perspiration absorption strap.
The in-suit drink bag is a dielectrically sealed bag assembly attached to the interior of the HUT that supplies drinking water to the crewmember during EVA. The drink bag is available in two sizes with the capacity for 21 or 32 fluid ounces of water. The in-suit drink bag includes the following components: bladder, inlet valve, drink valve, drink tube, and velcro attachments.
The urine collection device (UCD) is a disposable, flexible container that has the capacity to hold up to 32 fluid ounces of urine. The UCD is worn under the LCVG by male crewmembers during EVA. It is designed for one-time use, then disposed of as wet trash. The UCD includes the following components: collection bag, attachment straps, one-way check valve, and disposable roll-on cuff.
The maximum absorption garment (MAG) consists of multiple layers of material designed to rapidly absorb and store urine. The MAG is designed to be worn under the LCVG by male or female crewmembers during EVA. It has the capacity to hold 32 fluid ounces of urine and is disposable after use. The MAG includes the following components, multilayer absorbent material and tape attachment straps.
Life Support System
The life support system (LSS) provides a safe living environment inside the EMU. The LSS provides a variety of functions while the crew- member performs an EVA, including provision
of breathing oxygen, suit pressurization, crew- member cooling, crewmember communications, displays and controls for crewmember opera- tion of the EMU, and monitoring of EMU consumables and operational integrity. The life support system consists of the following:
  Primary oxygen system
  Secondary oxygen pack
  Oxygen ventilation circuit
  Liquid transport system
  Feedwater circuit
  Electrical interfaces
  Extravehicular communicator (EMU radio)   Display and control module
  Caution and warning system.
The primary oxygen system, oxygen ventilation circuit, liquid transport system, feedwater circuit, electrical interfaces, extravehicular com- municator, and the caution and warning system make up the primary life support subsystem (PLSS). The secondary oxygen pack is a separate unit that is attached to the bottom of the PLSS. Together, the PLSS and the secondary oxygen pack make up the backpack of the EMU.
The primary oxygen system provides a crewmember with breathing oxygen and satisfies pressure requirements for EV A. The system stores 1.217 pounds of oxygen at 850 psia and 90° F . It delivers oxygen during EV A at 4.3 ± 0.1 psid, and maintains a metabolic use rate range of 0.02 to 0.33 lb/hr. The system is charged through a common multiple connection to the orbiter environmental control and life support system. Charging pressure is 850 ± 50 psig. The minimum usable pressure is 60 psi. The system performs various functions, including suit pressurization, provision of breathing oxygen, and water pressurization. The primary oxygen system includes the following components: oxygen tanks, oxygen tank pressure sensor, flow limiter, oxygen shutoff valve, oxygen actuator, suit pressure regulator, water pressure regulator, high mode relief valve, and low mode relief valve.
 The secondary oxygen system, also known as the secondary oxygen pack (SOP), is the backup assembly to the primary oxygen system. This backup system provides a minimum of 30 minutes of emergency oxygen in the purge mode. The SOP functions include suit pressuri- zation, provision of breathing oxygen, and some degree of cooling in the purge mode. There is no required crewmember interface to activate the SOP; it automatically activates whenever the oxygen actuator is in the EVA position and suit pressure is less than 3.9 psid. The SOP includes two oxygen tanks, containing a total of 2.65 pounds of oxygen at 5800 psia and 70° F. The system includes the following components: oxygen tanks, SOP inlet pressure gauge, first- stage regulator, interstage gauge, second-stage regulator/shutoff valve/flow restrictor, PLSS/ SOP interface connector, and oxygen tank pressure sensor.
The oxygen ventilation circuit forms a closed loop with the space suit assembly. The circuit provides oxygen for breathing, suit pressuriza- tion for intravehicular activity (IVA) and EVA operation, and ventilation for cooling and elimination of exhaled gases. The oxygen flow picks up heat, humidity, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, which are removed from the EMU by the ventilation circuit components. The system includes the following components: fan/water separator, slurper/ sublimator, vent
flow sensor/backflow check valve, suit pressure sensor, suit pressure gauge, contaminant control (lithium hydroxide) cartridge (CCC), carbon dioxide sensor, display control module purge valve, helmet purge valve, positive pressure relief valve, negative pressure relief valve, SOP checkout package, muffler, and SOP checkout fixture. Ventilation flow is picked up at the body extremities and returned to the upper torso via a vent duct manifold that is part of the LCVG. From the upper torso, the gas is routed back into the PLSS and the CCC. The CCC is sized to absorb 1.48 pounds of carbon dioxide associated with 7000 Btu of metabolic activity over a 7-hour EVA period. The cartridge is installed in the back of the PLSS and is replaceable on orbit. On the ground, the used cartridge can be recharged for future use.
The liquid transport system uses the centrifugal pump to circulate approximately 240 lb/hr of water through the LCVG. The function served by the liquid transport system is to provide cooling to the crewmember. The system in- cludes the following components: pump, tem- perature control valve, LCVG, gas trap, pump priming valve, pump check valve, sublimator temperature sensor, and service and cooling umbilical bypass valve. During IV A operation, the pump circulates water not only through the EMU, but also through the service and cooling umbilical to the orbiter heat exchanger.
 Secondary Oxygen Pack
  The feedwater circuit contains the equipment and water to dissipate heat loads imposed on the system by the crewmember, the PLSS, and the environment. It also contains equipment to remove moisture from the ventilation circuit and gas from the transport circuit, to separate the water and gas, and to put them back in their respective loops. The feedwater circuit func- tions involve heat rejection, LCVG water makeup, and vent loop condensate separation and storage. The system includes the following components: feedwater tanks (2 primary/1 reserve), feedwater tank pressure sensors, reserve feedwater tank check valve, feedwater pressure regulator, feedwater shutoff valve, feedwater pressure sensor, sublimator, feed- water relief valve, condensate water relief valve, water separator, and coolant isolation valve. The primary and reserve tanks store approxi- mately 10 pounds of feedwater at 15 psig. The reserve feedwater tank provides 30 minutes of water for EMU cooling in the event that primary feedwater is depleted. Potable water from the orbiter ECLSS is used to fill or recharge the tanks.
The EMU electrical system is composed of the following main components: battery , feedwater shutoff valve, coolant isolation valve, motor, instrumentation, extravehicular communicator,
display and control module, and caution and warning system. Electrical interfaces exist between the display and control module and parts of the PLSS, SOP, and C/W. The power supply for operation of all electrical components of the EMU is a battery installed in the back of the PLSS. The EMU battery consists of eleven sealed, silver-zinc, high current density cells connected in series. The battery provides a minimum of 26.6 amp-hr of power over a 7-hour EVA mission at a nominal voltage of 16.5 V dc.
The extravehicular communicator (EVC) is composed of two parts, the orbiter-based equip- ment and the EMU-based equipment. The orbiter equipment consists of the EV A/air traffic control transceivers and antennas. This configuration provides communication with the EV A crewmembers and relay between EV A crewmembers and the ground (including down- link ECG and real-time data system (RTDS) telemetry). The EMU equipment consists of the EMU radio and antenna. It provides voice communications with other EVA crewmembers and the orbiter, ECG/RTDS telemetry to the orbiter for recording and/or downlink, and caution and warning tones to alert the EVA crewmember of anomalies or other significant events. The EVC includes the following compo-
LiOH Cartridge
 nents: orbiter UHF system, EMU radio, EMU electrical harness, communications carrier assembly, biomed sensors, COMM MODE selec- tor switch, COMM switch, volume controls, and real-time data system. Orbiter panels O6, A1R, and R10 are the crew communication interfaces. The panels control UHF operation, air-to-air or ground transmission, and biomed data down- link/recording respectively.
The display and control module (DCM) contains all controls and displays necessary for nominal operation and monitoring of EMU systems. The DCM includes the following components: POWER mode switch, DISPL switch, FAN switch, COMM switch, communications volume controls, display intensity control, oxygen actuator, temperature control valve, pressure gauge, DCM purge valve, alphanumeric display COMM mode selector, and WATER switch. The DCM is installed on the hard upper torso, with the surfaces covered with a TMG. This TMG contains the labels for the controls and displays.
The EMU caution and warning system (CWS) consists of instrumentation and a microprocessor to obtain, process, and visually display information for use by the EVA crewmember in the operation and management of the EMU. The system contains built-in test equipment (BITE), consisting of software and hardware that verify proper CWS operation. CWS serial data are also routed to the ground by the real-time data system. The CWS functions involve displaying EMU leak check procedures, monitoring and displaying EMU consumables status, monitoring EMU operational integrity, and alerting crewmembers to EMU anomalies. The system includes the following components: alphanumeric display with BITE indicator, dis- play (DISPL) switch, alert/status/warning tones, sensors, and "black box" processor. The CWS receives inputs from EMU sensors and from the DISPL switch located on the DCM. Sensors gather information throughout the EMU system and relay it to the CWS. Information is provided on pressures, temperatures, currents, and voltages.
 Display and Control Module
 EMU Ancillary Equipment
The EMU ancillary equipment consists of hardware necessary to support the EMU during all phases of EV A (prep/post/operation). The following list itemizes the components with a brief description of their functions.
EMU helmet lights - attach to the helmet EVVA and provide two functionally independent sets of lights for portable lighting during an EVA task.
EMU scissors - steel cutters with one serrated edge capable of cutting anything from fabric bags and straps to lightweight steel cable and Kevlar cord.
EMU wrist mirror - attaches to the wrist of the EVA glove to allow the EVA crewmember to view the controls and displays on the front of the EMU.
EVA cuff checklist - a set of reference cards bound by an aluminum alloy bracket attached to a wrist band. The reference cards, approxi- mately 4 inches by 5 inches in size, contain procedures and reference data for performing EVA tasks and for aiding in the diagnosis and resolution of EMU malfunctions.
Food stick - a fruit bar contained in an edible wrapper, positioned just above the neck ring adjacent to the drink valve on the in-suit drink bag.
In-suit drink bag syringe - a device used to remove gas from the water in the drink bag. The needle of the syringe is inserted in the inlet valve of the bag, and gas is suctioned out of the bag with the syringe.
Thermal mittens - an adjustable enclosure composed of several layers of thermal blankets and aluminized Mylar with a layer of Nomex felt on the palm and undersides of the fingers that fit conformally around the EV gloves to provide greater thermal hand protection at extreme high and low temperature worksites.
Lower torso assembly donning handles - left and right handles that aid in the mating of the hard upper torso and lower torso assembly halves of the waist ring.
Contingency tool - a pry bar used to disconnect the LTA and HUT halves of the waist ring in the event that the latching mechanism becomes jammed. Operation of the pry bar may damage the latching mechanism; therefore, it should be used only if the waist ring becomes jammed and the crewmember is entrapped in the space suit.
Bends treatment adapter (BTA) - an emergency device that may be used on-orbit in the event an EVA crewmember contracts decompression sickness (bends). The BTA converts the EMU into a hyperbaric treatment chamber, pressuriz- ing the EMU to 8.0 psid over ambient cabin pressure.
SOP checkout fixture - a flight support test item installed on the HUT half of the neck ring during pre-EVA operations.
DCM plug - a cover that attaches to the multiple connector on the DCM in the event that water begins leaking from the connector after the service and cooling umbilical multiple connector is removed.
Prep kit - items necessary for preparing the EMU for EVA, such as antifog wipes, tissue-type wipes, scissors, and urine collection device clamps.
Maintenance kit - additional equipment neces- sary for routine EMU maintenance, including valsalva devices, stericide wipes, lubricant wipes, antifog wipes, and urine collection device roll-on cuffs.
Bio kit - equipment associated with the biomed instrumentation, including EVA cables, over- tapes, electrode placement illustration, alcohol wipes, stoma seals, and electrode paste.
Airlock stowage bag - a Nomex bag used for temporary storage and transfer of items used in prep- and post-EV A operations. When stowed in the airlock over the inner hatch, the bag and its contents are removed from the airlock prior to airlock depressurization.
EVA bag - used to stow various items (camera, thermal mittens, tool caddy) in the airlock for possible use during EVA. The EVA bag remains in the airlock during the EV A.
 Airlock
An airlock on the orbiter accommodates astronaut EV A operations. The airlock permits EVA crewmembers to transfer from the mid- deck crew compartment into the payload bay in EMUs, without depressuring the orbiter crew cabin. The internal airlock provides launch and entry stowage of up to four EMUs, while the external airlock can stow two EMUs. Both types of airlock contain the interfaces and associated displays and controls for the orbiter systems that support EMU operation and servicing. Sized to accommodate a two-person EVA, the internal airlock dimensions have a diameter of 63 inches, a length of 83 inches, and two D-shaped 40-inch-diameter openings (three for external airlock). The internal airlock's volume measures 150 cubic feet, while the external airlock has a volume of 185 cubic feet. Support functions performed in the airlock include depressurization and repressurization, EV A equipment recharge, LCVG water cooling, and EV A equipment checkout, donning, and communications. All EVA gear, checkout panel, and recharge stations are located against the internal walls of the airlock.
Airlock Hatches
Two pressure-sealing hatches are mounted on the internal airlock, while the external airlock contains three of these hatches. The inner hatch is located on the exterior of the airlock opening into the middeck. The inner hatch isolates the airlock from the crew cabin. The outer hatch isolates the airlock from the unpressurized payload bay when closed and permits the EVA crewmembers to exit from the airlock to the payload bay when open. The external airlock's third hatch is an additional upper, outer hatch that will be used for docking operations. Each hatch has six interconnected latches with gearbox and actuator, a window, a hinge mechanism with hold-open device, a differential pressure gauge on each side, and two equalization valves.
Airlock repressurization is controlled from the middeck or inside the airlock. It is performed by equalizing the airlock and cabin pressure with airlock-hatch-mounted equalization valves on the inner hatch. Depressurization of the air- lock is controlled from inside the airlock. The airlock is depressurized by venting the airlock
pressure overboard. The two D-shaped airlock hatches are installed to open toward the pri- mary pressure source, the orbiter crew cabin, to achieve pressure-assist sealing when closed. Each hatch opening is 40 inches in diameter, yet with one side being flat, the minimum dimen- sion is 36 inches.
The 4-inch-diameter window in each airlock hatch is used for crew observation from the cabin to the airlock and the airlock to the payload bay. The dual window panes are made of polycarbonate plastic and are mounted di- rectly to the hatch using bolts fastened through the panes. Each airlock hatch has dual pressure seals to maintain the airlock's pressure integrity. One seal is mounted on the airlock hatch and the other on the airlock structure. A leak check quick disconnect is installed between the hatch and the airlock pressure seals to verify hatch pressure integrity before flight.
Each airlock hatch has the following design characteristics: (1) capable of being fully locked/unlocked from either side, (2) designed for 2000 open/close cycles, (3) one-handed operation by astronaut in pressure suit, (4) capable of opening against 0.2 psid maximum, (5) latches capable of withstanding 20 g's in the +X direction, and (6) actuator handle load of 30 pounds maximum.
The gearbox with latch mechanisms on each hatch allows the flight crew to open or close the hatch during transfers and EVA operations. The gearbox and the latches are mounted on the low-pressure side of each hatch, with a gearbox handle installed on both sides to permit opera- tion from either side of the hatch. Three of the six latches on each hatch are double-acting with cam surfaces that force the sealing surfaces apart when the latches are opened, thereby acting as crew-assist devices. To latch or unlatch the hatch, the gearbox handle must be rotated 440°.
The hatch actuator/gearbox is used to provide the mechanical advantage to open and close the latches. The hatch actuator lock lever requires a force of 8 to 10 pounds through an angle of 180° to unlatch the actuator. A minimum rotation of 440° with a maximum force of 30 pounds applied to the actuator handle is required to operate the latches to their fully unlatched positions.

External Airlock (port side view)
 External Airlock ISS Configuration (planned for OV-103, OV-104, OV-105)
  The hinge mechanism for each hatch permits a minimum opening sweep into the airlock or the crew cabin middeck.
The inner hatch of the internal airlock (airlock to crew cabin) is pulled or pushed forward to the crew cabin approximately 6 inches. The hatch pivots up and to the right side. Positive locks are provided to hold the hatch in both an intermediate and a full-open position. The outer hatch of the internal airlock (airlock to payload bay) opens and closes to the contour of the airlock wall. The hatch is hinged to be pulled first into the airlock and then forward at the bottom and rotated down until it rests with the low-pressure (outer) side facing the airlock ceiling (middeck floor). The hatch has a hold- open hook that snaps into place over a flange when the hatch is fully open. To support and protect the hatch against the airlock ceiling, the hatch incorporates two deployable struts.
The configuration of the external airlock, planned for International Space Station (ISS) operations, contains an inner hatch, an EV hatch, and a docking hatch. The inner hatch of the external airlock (airlock to crew cabin mid- deck) has the same opening mechanism as the outer hatch of the internal airlock. The hatch is hinged so that it can be pulled into the middeck and rotated down until it rests on the middeck floor. The EV hatch of the external airlock (airlock to payload bay) also opens in the same manner. The docking hatch, located on the floor of the external airlock (toward the payload bay doors), is hinged to be pulled into the airlock and then rotated until the low pressure side rests against the airlock wall facing toward the nose of the orbiter. The external airlock hatches also have hold-open protection and deployable struts for support against the airlock structure.

 Airlock Subsystems
The airlock air circulation system provides conditioned air to the airlock during non-EVA periods. The airlock revitalization system duct is attached to the outside airlock wall at launch. Upon airlock hatch opening in flight, the duct is rotated by the flight crew through the cabin/airlock hatch and installed in the airlock. The duct has a removable air diffuser cap, installed on the end of the flexible duct, which can adjust the air flow from 216 pounds per hour. The duct must be rotated out of the airlock before the cabin/airlock hatch is closed for chamber depressurization. During the EV A preparation period, the duct is rotated out of the airlock and can be used for supplemental air circulation in the middeck.
To assist the crewmember before and after EVA operations, the airlock incorporates handrails and foot restraints. Handrails are located alongside the avionics and ECLSS panels, with aluminum alloy handholds mounted on each side of the hatches. Each handrail has a clearance of 2.25 inches between the airlock wall and the handrail to allow crewmembers to grip it while wearing a pressurized glove. Foot restraints, sized for the EMU boot, can be installed on the airlock floor nearer the payload bay side. The ceiling handhold is installed nearer the cabin side of the airlock. A rotation release knob on the foot restraint is designed for shirt-sleeve operation and, therefore, must be positioned before the suit is donned. The foot restraint is bolted to the floor and cannot be removed in flight.
Airlock-based EMU support components provide for EMU stowage, EMU operational support, and EMU recharge during intravehicu- lar activity operations. These components include the EMU mount, the service and cooling umbilical, and the lower torso restraint bag. The EMU mount provides a mechanical interface between the EMU and airlock wall for EMU stowage. The mount attaches to the back side of the EMU and engages with three fixtures on the wall of the airlock. The mount is also used to maintain the EMU in a fixed position on orbit for EMU donning and doffing operations. If necessary, the EMU mount can be removed from the airlock wall while on orbit.
The service and cooling umbilical consists of three water hoses, a high pressure oxygen hose, electrical wiring, water pressure regulators, and a strain relief tether. The system is used to interconnect the EMU and the orbiter airlock for two major functions: electrical power, hardline communications, oxygen supply, wastewater drainage, and water cooling capability from the orbiter during IV A operation; and recharge capability for the PLSS oxygen tanks, water reservoir, and battery.
The lower torso restraint bag is attached to the bottom of the EMU mount and covers the lower torso of the EMU to restrain it during launch and entry. Straps on either side of the bag are attached to points on the upper part of the EMU mount and are tightened to ensure that the EMU is fully restrained.
For Spacelab/Spacehab module missions, the internal airlock is used along with a tunnel adapter that mates with the airlock and a Spacelab/Spacehab tunnel that is installed in the payload bay. The airlock tunnel adapter, hatches, tunnel extension, and tunnel permit the flightcrew to transfer from the orbiter's pressur- ized middeck compartment to the Spacelab/ Spacehab pressurized shirt-sleeve environment. An upper hatch in the tunnel adapter provides egress/ingress for EV A operations. The exter- nal airlock is used in conjunction with the tunnel adapter during Spacelab/Spacehab missions when the orbiter is docked to Mir or the ISS. In the event of an EVA, the flightcrew is not pres- ent in the Spacelab/Spacehab.
EVA Support Equipment
A variety of equipment is available to support the EVA crewmember. Depending on the task to be performed, the proper tool is available outside the airlock. The general equipment functions include securing the crewmember to the orbiter/RMS, providing the crewmember with mechanical assistance, and assisting the crewmember in mobility. The following list itemizes the EVA support components with a brief description of their functions.
Crewmember safety tether - ensures the crewmem- ber is positively tethered to the orbiter while providing access to all areas of the payload bay.
 Before airlock egress, this 55-foot safety tether is attached to a waist tether and remains attached at all times during EVA, while the crewmember translates from one area of the payload bay to another.
Slidewires - facilitate the translation of a crewmember and equipment in the forward and aft directions of the payload bay. Two slide- wires are installed for all STS flights on either side of the payload bay for a length of approxi- mately 46 feet.
Tethers - include waist and wrist tethers. Waist tethers are used to attach the crewmember to the orbiter safety tether system and to provide additional crewmember restraint at a worksite when required. Waist tethers use a large hook to be attached to various tether points (including the crewmember safety tether) and a small hook that attaches to an EMU waist tether ring. Wrist tethers are used to secure tools and hardware to the EVA crewmember and to tether points. Wrist tethers are both fixed and adjustable, attaching to loops on the EMU glove.
Handrails - aluminum tubing strategically located to aid in crewmember translation or restraint to accomplish a specific task. Hand- rails are located on the forward and aft bulk- heads, the hingeline of the payload bay doors, and the RMS end effector. Handrails are designed with tether attach points.
Portable foot restraint - a working platform designed to restrain the EVA crewmember while performing contingency operations on various components of the payload bay systems. The portable foot restraint stabilizes the crewmember by using a system of toe guides and heel clips designed to interface with the EMU boots.
EVA Winch - allows the EVA crewmember to close the payload bay doors in the event of a payload bay door drive system failure. Prior to launch, the winch is mounted on both the forward and aft payload bay bulkheads. The winch consists of a reel, assisted by spring energy, housing 24 feet of 3/8-inch-diameter Kevlar rope with a hook attached to the free end.
Provisions stowage assembly (PSA) - an aluminum tool stowage container mounted under the cargo bay liner, flush with the bottom of the payload bay. Tool box tether protocol: when stowing the tools in the PSA, the tools/tool caddies are tethered before they are removed from the mini-workstation and untethered only after they are securely placed in their corre- sponding storage cavity. The tools listed below are contained within the PSA.
Mini-workstation - a mechanical device that mounts on the front of the EMU to stow tools and to provide a means of tether restraint for an EV A crewmember at a worksite.
Tube cutter - used for a contingency door-closing operation. The tool consists of spring-loaded retention rollers, a cutter wheel mounted on a slide, a blade ratchet handle, a rotating body, a control lever, and a tube-cutter ratchet handle. It is designed to cut drive door linkages.
Payload bay doors disconnect tools - used to disengage the payload bay doors power drive unit(s) (two) from the power-drive-unit torque shaft, allowing manual closing of the doors. The tool is approximately 6-3/4 inches long from the tip of the tether ring to the end of the 3/8-inch steel square drive extension. Additional tools for disconnecting the door drive linkage system include vise-grip, ratcheting box-end wrench, adjustable wrench, loop pin extractor, Velcro/ tape caddy, bolt puller, and trash bag.
Three-point latch tool - used to compensate for failed bulkhead latches. The tool consists of a stowable ratchet handle, two interchangeable tool handles, a ratchet control selection lever, a spring-loaded compensator, and two fixed-load pickup points.
Centerline latch tool - used to compensate for a failed payload bay door centerline latch. The tool consists of a fixed-load and a spring-loaded pickup point, plus a reversible ratchet with a stowable handle and a pair of trigger release buttons with a safety that prevents an accidental release.
Airlock latch disconnect tool - a common, EVA- modified, crescent wrench used to force open a jammed latch and/or latches disconnected from the rotary actuator. The other contingency air- lock disconnect tool is a drive ratchet with a 7/16-inch hex socket and 4-inch extension.
 RMS rope reel - used in conjunction with the snatch blocks in the event of an RMS joint failure. The reel consists of a rope spool, spool bracket, rope guide, and cam cleats. The rope reel contains approximately 80 feet of 5/16- inch-diameter Kexlon rope.
Snatch block - a common marine device used, in the event of an RMS failure, in conjunction with the RMS rope reel and EVA winch to backdrive the RMS to a stowed position.
Payload retention device (PRD) - used as an on- orbit temporary tiedown tool so that the article or payload being secured can be repositioned as necessary to prevent damage. It consists of a housing that encloses a 15-foot Kevlar webbing strap on a spring-loaded reel.
RMS manipulator positioning mechanism wrench (RMS MPM wrench) - a double-ended, open-end steel wrench used to deploy or stow the MPMs (in the event the MPM motors fail) by manually turning the drive shaft in the appropriate direction, thus allowing for payload deployment and/or payload bay door closing.
RMS shoulder brace release - a flat steel bar with an angled foot used to disengage the RMS shoulder brace locking mechanism, thus releas- ing the shoulder brace. If the lock is not released, the RMS is inoperative.
Grapple fixture release tools - used to remove a grapple fixture shaft should an end effector malfunction, failing to release a payload. The tools include a probe and 1/2-inch ratcheting box-end wrench.
Radiator actuator disconnect tools - A 3/8-inch drive ratchet and 1/4-inch allen wrench exten- sion used to disconnect a failed radiator actuator and support stowage of the radiators.
External tank umbilical door tool - used to override a failed external tank door centerline latch and support ET door closure.
Generic jam removal tools - diagonal cutter, cable cutter, needle nose pliers, probe, hammer, pry- bar, forceps, trash bag. For use in disconnecting or dislodging jams in various orbiter mecha- nisms, such as PLBD hinges, latches, etc.
Portable foot restraint (PFR) bridge clamp - provides a PFR socket that mounts on the sill of the PLB in available locations on existing bridge rails.
Simplified Aid for EV A Rescue
The simplified aid for EVA rescue (SAFER) is a small, self-contained, propulsive backpack system used to provide a free-flying rescue capability for an EVA crewmember. SAFER is a "simplified," single-string system that fits on the bottom of the EMU PLSS and attaches to existing mounts on the sides of the PLSS. In essence, SAFER is a small simplified version of the manned maneuvering unit (MMU). Because it is intended for self rescue use only, SAFER does not have the propellant capacity and systems redundancy that was provided with the MMU.
SAFER is designed to be used as a self-rescue device for a separated EVA crewmember in situations where the orbiter is unavailable to provide rescue capability. Such situations would include when the orbiter is docked to a large payload or structure, such as the Russian Mir Space Station or ISS. The SAFER will also be used during all future ISS EVA operations where the orbiter might not be present at theISSduringanEVA.
To provide self-rescue capability, the SAFER offers 13 minutes of propellant and control authority to stabilize and return a tumbling/ separating EVA crewmember. The SAFER has 24 gaseous-nitrogen (GN2) thrusters to provide 6 degrees-of-freedom maneuvering control. The SAFER is controlled by a single hand controller housed in a hand controller module box located on the bottom of the unit. The SAFER propul- sion subsystem provides a total delta velocity of at least 10 ft/sec with an initial charge. The flight unit weighs approximately 85 pounds and folds for launch, landing, and on-orbit stowage.
The SAFER is the product of a Johnson Space Center (JSC) in-house project to develop, build, and produce a rescue device for the instances when the orbiter cannot provide rescue capability and for ISS EVA operations. An on-orbit SAFER detailed test objective (DTO) conducted on space shuttle mission STS-64 was very successful. This DTO demonstrated SAFER's operational capabilities and collected performance data to augment the design and development of the final operational SAFER. The STS-76 SAFER was a transitional unit between the DTO unit flown on STS-64 and the final production unit that will be manifested for ISS. The operational unit will be capable of being stationed on-orbit for 1 year; however, after use on orbit, the unit will be returned to Earth for refurbishing.

 Operations
As previously discussed, there are three types of EV A: scheduled, unscheduled, and contin- gency. A scheduled EVA is defined as any EVA incorporated into the normal flight plan in order to complete a specific mission objective. An unscheduled EVA is not part of the flight plan; rather, it is conducted to achieve payload opera- tion success or to advance overall mission accomplishments. A contingency EV A is also unscheduled, but is required to ensure safe return of the orbiter and flight crew.
Regardless of the EVA type, a series of proce- dures are required to initiate and terminate an EV A. These procedures cover an integrated timeline sequence from the EVA checklist. The detailed procedures are summarized for refer- ence in the following steps:
1. Quick don mask prebreathe - Donning of the mask for prebreathe and cabin depressurization.
2. Cabin depressurization to 10.2 psi - Reducing the cabin pressure from 14.7 psi to 10.2 psi.
3. EMU checkout - Preliminary checkout of the EMU systems prior to EMU donning.
4. Middeck preparation and preparation for donning - Configuration of the EMU and its ancillary components for crewmember donning.
5. Suit donning - Crewmember donning of the EMU and ancillary components, approximately 40 minutes duration.
6. EMU check - Configuration and check- out of the EMU prior to EMU purge.
7. EMU purge - Nitrogen purge of the EMU prior to prebreathe.
8. Prebreathe - Crewmember acclimation to lower chamber pressure, over a period of 40 to 70 minutes.
9. Preparation for depressurization - Configuration of the airlock and
closing the inner hatch prior to airlock depressurization.
10. Airlock depressurization - Configura- tion and checkout of the EMU, airlock depressurization to vacuum, and opening of the outer hatch.
11. Airlock repressurization - Airlock repressurization and opening of the inner hatch.
12. Post-EVA - Shutdown of the EMU systems and doffing of the EMU and ancillary components.
13. EMU maintenance/recharge - Change- out or recharge of the EMU battery and lithium hydroxide cartridge and general cleaning of the EMU for subsequent EVA; recharge of the EMU water system.
14. Post-EVA entry preparation - Recon- figuration and restowage of the EMU and airlock equipment.
A set of procedures are followed when a crewmember has contracted the bends during an EV A. The crewmember discontinues the EVA and returns to the airlock to connect to the service and cooling umbilical. The airlock is repressed to 10.2 psia, and the cabin is repressed to 14.7 psia. The helmet is doffed, and the crewmember drinks a minimum of 32 ounces of fluids. After proper EMU reconfiguration, the bends treatment adapter is installed for bends recovery.
Scheduling an EVA is a very complex and involved task. The following list outlines the general mission constraints regarding EVA, but does not attempt to define the detailed specific activities.
  The maximum scheduled duration for an EVA is 6 hours.
  All scheduled and unscheduled EV As require two crewmembers.
  No scheduled or unscheduled EV A shall occur on flight day 1 (~24 hours MET).
   No scheduled EVA shall be planned to occur prior to flight day 4 (~72 hours MET) unless:
i) A specific flight is dedicated to scheduled EVA activity, and
ii) That payload customer has specifically negotiated with NASA
for the early scheduled EV A capability, and an exemption is processed.
  The latest an EVA may be scheduled in preflight planning is EOM-2.
  No unscheduled EV A shall be planned to occur prior to flight day 3 (~48 hours MET) unless:
i) A specific payload has no alterna- tive but to utilize an EVA as its third level of redundancy for the purpose of a critical backup to deploy/operations that would prevent loss of the payload, and
ii) That payload customer has been made aware of the inherent risk that the EVA may not be able to be performed due to crew status, and the customer has agreed to accept the risk, and
iii) That payload customer has spe- cifically negotiated with NASA
for the early unscheduled EV A capability, and an exemption is processed.
  The following are required response times prior to an unscheduled payload EVA:
i) Upon the discovery of a failure leading to an EVA, approximately
24 hours are allotted for EV A preparation prior to starting actual EV A maintenance on a failed component.
ii) If the case above occurs on launch day, then approximately 44 hours are allotted prior to starting EVA maintenance.
iii) If a payload requires a shorter EV A response time, then the requirement for that EVA must be negotiated with NASA, and an exemption must be processed.
  Payload activities that could require an unscheduled EVA at the end of a mission may only be scheduled if there are sufficient consumables and landing opportunities to extend the mission to perform the EVA and preserve 2 wave- off days.
  A minimum of 1 flight day must sepa- rate two scheduled EVAs, for any given EVA crewmember.
  A contingency EVA will be scheduled in real time whenever it is necessary to restore the orbiter to a configuration for safe return.
Contingency EVAs occur if orbiter hardware sustains a malfunction. Procedures, tools, and specified work locations are identified for practice on any STS mission. The recognized failures pertain to the following orbiter systems: radiator actuator, payload bay doors, bulkhead latches, centerline latches, airlock hatch, remote manipulator system (RMS), bulkhead camera, Ku-band antenna, and external tank doors. The corrective actions for each system failure are itemized in the following table.

 EVA Summary Data
  EV A refers to operations performed outside the spacecraft crew compartment.
  For generic orbiter missions, two suits are included with consumables provided for
three, two-person, 6-hour EV As.
  There are three basic categories of EVA: scheduled, unscheduled, and contingency.
  The extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) is an independent anthropomorphic system that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and communications for the crewmember to perform EVA in Earth orbit. An EVA is defined, for EMU design consid- erations, as any time the EMU external environmental pressure is below 4.0.
  The EMU is an integrated assembly, primar- ily composed of the space suit assembly, life support system, and numerous items of associated support and ancillary equipment.
EVA Rules of Thumb
  Always use "make before break" tether proto- col.
  Don't use the glove as a hammer.
  EV A crewmember and equipment must
remain tethered at all times.
  Slow and deliberate motion provides much greater stability than quick, jerky motions.
  Body positioning is 90 percent of the task.
  Each EVA crewmember should check out his or her own EMU.
  The orbiter's airlock permits EVA flight crew members to transfer from the middeck crew compartment into the payload bay in EMUs without depressurizing the orbiter crew cabin. The airlock also provides launch and entry stowage of up to three EMUs.
  The airlock's support functions include air- lock depressurization and repressurization, EV A equipment recharge, LCVG water cool- ing, EV A equipment checkout, donning, and communications.
  Depending on the task to be performed, the proper tool is available outside the airlock. The general EV A-support equipment func- tions include securing the crewmember to the orbiter/RMS, providing the crewmember with mechanical assistance, and assisting the crewmember in mobility.
  A standard series of procedures (pre and post operations) are required to initiate and termi- nate an EV A, regardless of the EV A type.

            <Title>The Editor</Title>
            <Text>The text you are reading now is contained in the editor. There are several ways to load a document into the editor, but the one you will use most often is to select a file in the binder, as you did to load this one.
Scrivener’s editor can display a range of different file types, so let’s try loading an image:
	•	In the binder, scroll down to the “Research” folder (you might need to expand it by clicking on the triangle next to it first) and then click on “Sunset”.
	•	Once you’ve tested that out, return here.
Using the Editor
	•	The Format Bar appears directly below the toolbar. It provides easy access to many common formatting controls, such as bold, italics, paragraph alignment and spacing, and highlights.
	•	More formatting features can be found in the Format menu.
	•	The Insert menu allows you to insert images, tables, footnotes, comments and other elements into the text.
	•	Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find… in the main menu or using the keyboard shortcut Cmd-F brings up the Find panel, allowing you to search through text in the editor.
	•	If you’re a screenwriter, playwright or comic writer, you can enter scriptwriting mode via Format &gt; Scriptwriting. (You can also toggle between scriptwriting and regular modes using the keyboard shortcut Cmd-8.)
The Header View
The header view (or bar) runs across the top of the editor and contains the name of the document, along with providing some useful tools.
Because in Scrivener you can break your writing up into sections as large or small as you want, you’ll spend a lot of time jumping between them in the binder. Frequently, you’ll simply want to return to the last document you were looking at. You can do so using the history navigation buttons:
	•	Try clicking on the back button (the left-pointing chevron) on the left of the header bar. It will take you to the previous document you were looking at.
	•	Click on the forward button next to it to return here.
	•	The up and down chevrons on the right of the header view work similarly, except that instead of navigating through the document history, they take you to the next or previous document in the binder.
Note: After navigating with the history buttons, the binder selection may not match what is shown in the main editor. (You can thus check back on a document you edited earlier without losing your place.) When the editor shows a different document to the one selected in the binder, a secondary light grey bar appears in the binder to indicate the current editor document.
Tip: Using Navigate &gt; Reveal in Binder tells the binder to select the document currently open in the editor.
Also in the header bar:
	•	You can Control-click (or right-click) into the header view to bring up a menu of useful options.
	•	You can click into the title to rename the document.
	•	You can drag the icon shown next to the title in the same way that you can drag documents in the binder.
	•	You can drag a document from the binder into the header bar to load it.
	•	The square icon on the very right of the header view will split the editor, but we’ll come to that shortly.
The Footer View
The footer view is the horizontal bar beneath the editor. It will contain slightly different controls depending on what is open in the editor.
	•	When text is open in the editor, its word count is shown in the footer view. (You can change this to show the character count using Scrivener’s “Editing” preferences, available from Scrivener &gt; Preferences… in the main menu.) Click on the word count for more information.
	⁃	Tip #1: If the word count ever disappears from the footer view, it is most likely because you have switched on scriptwriting mode (see above).
	⁃	Tip #2: To see the word count of your entire draft, hover over the search field in the toolbar with your mouse. Doing so will display a count of all the words in the Draft folder (on the left) and a count of the words you have written in the current session (on the right).
	⁃	Tip #3: You can set a word or character count target for your manuscript via Project &gt; Show Project Targets. (You can also set targets for individual documents by clicking on the target icon in the footer view.)
	•	You can change the current text scale (zoom) using the percentage control on the left of the footer view. (This does not change the font size; it just zooms in and out of the document.)
	•	When viewing PDF files, the footer view allows you to navigate between the pages. Click on “spacewalk_info” in the Research folder to test this out, and then come back here by clicking on the “back” arrow in the header view.
At this point, now that you know how to use the binder and editor, you could go off and start using Scrivener, because the binder and editor are the two features you’ll be using the most. So if you’re itching to jump in, feel free to go and create your own project (File &gt; New Project…) and experiment. Just know that, like Luke Skywalker at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, you’re not fully trained in the ways of the Force just yet. Be sure to come back to Dagobah here as soon as you’re ready to continue your training.
Ready? Okay, click on “The Inspector” in the binder (or the down chevron on the right of the header view) and let’s do ourselves some inspecting.</Text>

            <Title>Transcription</Title>
            <Text>Transcribing audio and media files in Scrivener is easy with the split view. Try the following:
	1.	Split the editor vertically or horizontally.
	2.	Click into one of the editors.
	3.	In the binder, select “ThisIsBuzzAldrin” inside the “Research” folder so that it loads in the editor. “ThisIsBuzzAldrin” is an audio file, so you won’t see much other than the play controls when you mouse over the editor. (Actually, that audio file is the beginning of the coolest phone message I ever picked up; sadly, the message was not for me).
Now you can play the audio file in one editor while typing in the other.
You can control the media file using the keyboard shortcuts defined in the Navigate &gt; Media menu. Cmd-Return will play or pause the file, for instance, without your having to click away from your typing.
Also note the button in the left of the media file’s footer bar:
#

That is the “pause and rewind” button. If you click it, it will change colour, indicating that it is on. When “pause and rewind” is turned on, whenever you pause the media file it will automatically be rewound a couple of seconds (you can determine exactly how many seconds it gets rewound in the Behaviors pane of the Preferences, under “Playback”). This is very useful for transcription.</Text>

            <Text>The index card in the inspector can be used to show an image instead of a synopsis. If an image is used instead of a synopsis, then the image will also be used on the corkboard. This could be useful if you have a document about a character and want a photo to represent the character on the corkboard, for instance.
To use an image in the index card for a document:
	1.	Open the Inspector.
	2.	Select the notes pane so that the synopsis and notes are displayed.
	3.	In the synopsis header bar, click on the icon of the picture. The synopsis area will be replaced with a grey area saying “Drop an image here.”
	4.	Locate the image you wish to use in the Finder and drag it into the grey area.
To switch back to the synopsis, click on the index card icon in the synopsis header bar (this will not remove the image, but just toggle back to displaying the synopsis).</Text>

            <Text>You can switch to page layout view to view your text on virtual pages in one of the following ways:
	•	Click on the “View” toolbar item and select “Show Page View”.
	•	Go to View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Show Page View in the main menu.
Note that the pages you see on screen may not match what you see when the text is compiled for print or export. The concept of pages is largely meaningless in Scrivener, because you work on the different parts of your manuscript in smaller pieces and can completely change the formatting and insert other elements, such as titles, during the Compile process. The final arrangement of the pages isn’t known until the text is compiled into one document.
Thus, unlike traditional word processors where the page layout view shows exactly what you will see when you print your document, in Scrivener it is just another way of viewing your text, for writers who just feel more comfortable seeing pages fill up on the screen.</Text>

            <Title>Backing Up</Title>
            <Text>Although Scrivener is designed to be as stable as possible, and its auto-save should ensure your work is constantly saved, with important writing projects it’s always a good idea to make regular backups, saved to either cloud services or external hard drives, so that your work is always safe no matter what happens.
Automatic Backups
By default, Scrivener will back up a project every time it is closed, and up to a maximum of five backups of each project will be kept around (with newer backups replacing older ones). You can change this behaviour and also choose the folder in which automatic backups are stored, as follows:
	1.	From the main menu, choose Scrivener &gt; Preferences…
	2.	Click on the “Backup” toolbar icon in the Preferences panel that appears. 
You will be presented with a number of options that allow you to determine when and how backups are made.
Click the “Choose…” button next to “Backup location” to change the automatic backups folder, and click the “Open backup folder…” button to open the folder currently used for backups in the Finder.
Manual Backups
There are two ways of manually creating a backup of a project:
	1.	Go to File &gt; Backup &gt; Back Up Now. This will create a new backup of the project in the automatic backups folder (as determined by the Preferences).
	2.	Go to File &gt; Back Up &gt; Back Up To… You will be presented with a chooser panel, allowing you to choose where the backup should be saved.

            <Text>Phew! We’ve now covered all major features of Scrivener. If you haven’t done so already, then soon you are going to want to create your own project and get writing. Generally you will want to create a separate Scrivener project for each writing project.
To create a new project:
	1.	Select New Project… from the File menu. This will open the project templates chooser panel.
	2.	Choose a project template from one of the categories (e.g. novel, screenplay, thesis).
	3.	Click “Choose…” to specify a location at which to save the project.
Note: Scrivener projects are saved onto your hard drive with the file extension “.scriv” (in the same way that Word documents are saved with the file extension “.docx”). When you create a new project, make sure you know where you are saving it, so that you can locate it in the Finder. If you ever move to another computer, you’ll want to make sure that you back up and copy your .scriv projects to your new computer.

            <Title>Key Concepts</Title>
            <Text>What is Scrivener?
Scrivener is aimed at writers of all stripes—novelists, journalists, academics, screenwriters, playwrights—who need to structure a long piece of text. It’s a ring-binder, a scrapbook, a corkboard, an outliner and a text editor that’s tailor-made for growing a manuscript.
Below you’ll find a brief survey of the key concepts behind Scrivener—the ideas that led me to put down my pen, learn programming, and create Scrivener in the first place.
Writing
Conventional word processors are wonderful for all kinds of things, but, because I like to jump around writing different sections as they come to me, I’ve always struggled with them when it comes to writing anything of length. Scrivener makes it easy to compose in any order you want, whether that’s from start to finish or completely at random.
Word processors only ever know about the document you’re working on at any one time—if you have numerous documents pertaining to a single project, it’s up to you to keep track of them. By contrast, each project you create in Scrivener can contain as many documents as you desire, allowing you to write in chunks as large or small as you wish. If you’re writing a novel, you can write each chapter in a separate document, or you can break it down further and write each scene in a different document—it’s up to you. When you come to export or print your work, all of those myriad sections can be compiled into a single document.
Research
Scrivener projects aren’t only for storing text. Much writing requires research, and you can import your research documents—images, PDF files, web pages, even movie and sound files—directly into Scrivener. You can then refer to your research right alongside your writing.
Outlining and Structuring
Every writer approaches the task of pulling together ideas in a different way. To that end, Scrivener allows you to choose whatever structure best fits your project, and to work with an overview of that structure.
Scrivener’s sidebar (the “binder”) shows a nested list of documents that can be expanded and collapsed, so that you can work with your whole outline or only subsections of it. Here you can create not only as many text files as you wish, but also folders to contain your text files, and you can have folders within folders within folders. You can even nest text files inside other text files: in Scrivener, a folder is simply a special type of text file, and you can freely convert between one and the other.
How you structure your project is for you to decide—you might have a folder for each chapter, containing text documents for each scene; you might have no folders and just use text documents for each chapter; you might do something completely different. There’s no right way or wrong way—only your way.
Every document in a Scrivener project is associated with a synopsis and notes (assigned using the inspector). Scrivener’s outliner and corkboard views show only the synopsis and title of each document, allowing you to step back and see the forest for the trees. You can assign synopses manually or leave them blank, in which case the first lines of the text are shown. This makes it easy to get an overview of your work, and to restructure it via drag and drop.
If the idea of outlines makes you shudder, never fear: Scrivener imposes no fixed approach to writing and outlining. You might start by creating a bunch of folders and empty text files, creating synopses for each one in the corkboard or outliner. Then you might go through and fill in the text files, referring to the synopses as a prompt for what you need to write. Conversely, you might write like crazy and worry about all the structural stuff only when your first draft is complete. In that case, you can just type away, creating new text documents as and when you feel like it, and you can split things apart and rearrange everything only much later in the process. Or you can use a combination of both methods.
So let’s dive in. In the binder sidebar, you will see a folder entitled “Draft”. Beneath this, indented, you will see “The Basics”, “Get Oriented”, “Main Interface” and more. To get started, click on “Main Interface”. </Text>

            <Title>Scratch Pad and Clippings</Title>
            <Text>If you have to gather a lot of research in other applications and find yourself doing a lot of copying and pasting into Scrivener, the Scratch Pad and clippings features may come in handy.
Scratch Pad
The scratch pad is a panel that can be called up from any other application using a keyboard shortcut that you set in the “General” pane of the Preferences (the default shortcut is Shift-Cmd-Return). You can paste or type notes into it and send them to one of your open projects either straight away or at some point later (scratch pad notes are saved in a folder on your hard drive that you can specify in the preferences—they are not part of any project).
Clippings Services
Scrivener also makes some clipping features available via the global macOS Services menu. To enable them:
	1.	Open System Preferences.
	2.	Open the “Keyboard” pane of System Preferences.
	3.	Select the “Shortcuts” tab at the top.
	4.	Select “Services” in the sidebar.
	5.	Scroll down to the “Scrivener” services in the list and tick any that you wish to enable.

            <Title>Collections</Title>
            <Text>Collections provide a way of keeping different lists of binder documents around. There are two types of collection:
	1.	Arbitrary collections. You can add any documents you want to these and drag and drop to have them in any order.
	⁃	Suppose you are reading through your manuscript and realise that a number of sections have problems in them that you are going to need to solve. You could create a collection called “Problems” and add any problematic documents to it. You could then open that collection to work through the problematic documents.
	2.	Search collections allow you to save a search and re-run it at any time.
	⁃	Suppose you are writing a novel and have used labels to record the point of view of each chapter. You could set up different search collections for each point-of-view character. Each search collection would search for the character name in the label. You could then look open one of the collections to see only the chapters or scenes for a particular character.
Opening Collections
In the toolbar:
	•	Click on the “View” button on the left.
	•	Select “Show Collections”.
	⁃	An area will appear at the top of the binder containing two rows (tabs), “Binder” and “Search Results”.
	•	Click on the “Search Results” row.
See what happened? The last search you ran gets run again, and its results appear where the binder was.
Click on the “Binder” tab to return to the binder before continuing.
Arbitrary Collections
To create an arbitrary collection:
	•	Ctrl-click on the header view to bring up the header bar menu.
	•	Select “Lock in Place”:
#
The header bar will turn a different shade of grey, indicating that the editor is now “locked”. When an editor is locked, clicks in the binder will have no effect. Try clicking on different documents in the binder to see what I mean—they will no longer get loaded into the editor when selected as they normally do. We have locked the editor so that you can still read this document while trying out the following steps.
	•	Hold down the Command key on the keyboard and select several documents in the binder.
	•	Once you have selected five or six (it doesn’t matter which), click on “+” button in the “Collections” bar at the very top of the binder:
#

The binder will be replaced by a flat list showing only the documents you selected. You haven’t moved those documents—they are all still in their rightful places in the binder. No, you’ve just created a collection. When you created it, the selected documents were automatically added to it.
To see what I mean click on one of the documents in the collection list and go to Navigate &gt; Reveal in Binder. This shows you where the document is located in the binder.
Click back on the collection tab that was created once you’ve tried this, to return to the collection.
	•	You can drag and drop the collection rows into any order you want.
	•	You can drag and drop documents inside the collection list to reorder them. (This has no effect on the order in the binder.)
	•	You can rename the collection to anything you want, and you can change its colour by clicking on the little chevron next to the collection name:
#
Go ahead and try changing the title and colour of the collection you created.
Let’s add some more documents to the collection:
	•	Click back on the “Binder” tab and select some different documents in the binder.
	•	Once you’ve selected some documents, drag and drop them onto the collection tab.
#

	•	Click the collection tab again to return to the collection—the documents you dragged onto the tab are now in the collection too. (Note: If you hold the mouse over the tab for a moment before you drop, the collection will open automatically, allowing you to drop the documents in a particular place in the collection list.)
Tip: If you hold the Option key down while dragging a folder onto a collection, then all its subdocuments will get added to the collection too.
Search Collections
Let’s create a collection of all documents with their status marked “To Do”:
	1.	Open project search by clicking on the magnifying glass in the toolbar.
	2.	In the search field that appears above the binder, search for “To Do”. The binder will be replaced with the purple search results list.
	3.	Click on the magnifying glass icon on the left of the search field and select “Status” from the menu that appears. The search results will update to show only documents with a status of “To Do”.
	4.	Click on the  the magnifying glass in the search field again, and this time select “Save Search As Collection…” from the bottom of the menu.
	5.	Enter a name for the search, e.g. “To Do” (it will use the search phrase by default) and hit “OK”.
The search results will now change colour and you will see that a new tab has appeared in the list of collections named “To Do”. Again, you can rename this or change the colour to one of your choosing, just as you can with arbitrary collections. The magnifying glass icon on the left of the tab indicates that this is a search collection.
Search collections are different to arbitrary collections in that you can’t add documents to them or move them around. Instead, every time you click on a search collection, the search gets run again. To see what I mean:
	1.	Click back on the “Binder” tab.
	2.	Click on the “START HERE” document at the top of the binder and hit the space bar to bring up a Quick Reference panel.
	3.	Click on the “No Status” pop-up button in the bottom-right of the Quick Reference panel and choose “To Do” from the status menu.
	4.	Repeat this with a couple of other documents if you like.
	5.	Now click on the “To Do” collection again.
The “START HERE” document is now part of the “To Do” collection.
Deleting Collections
To delete a collection, simply select its tab and then click on the “-” button in the “Collections” header bar (you will be prompted to confirm the deletion). Deleting a collection has no effect on its constituent documents—they are not deleted and remain in their place in the binder.
Closing Collections
You can close a collection and return to the binder at any time by clicking the “X” button in the left of the collection header bar:
#


You can now unlock the editor either by Ctrl-clicking in the editor header bar again and deselecting “Lock in Place”. You can also hide the collections pane by choosing “Hide Collections” from the “View” toolbar button menu.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Learn about the various ways of finding things in Scrivener.</Synopsis>
            <Text>There are several ways of searching in Scrivener. Most commonly, you’ll use the following searching methods:
	•	When you want to open a particular document and you know its title or some text that appears in its synopsis, use the toolbar search field.
	•	When you want to search through your entire project for a phrase or word, use Project Search (the magnifying glass in the toolbar). The binder will be replaced with a list of search results.
	⁃	Select a search result to open it in the editor. Matching phrases or words will be highlighted.
	⁃	To quickly go through the matching phrases, click into the editor and hit Cmd-F to bring up the Find panel. This will automatically be populated with the current search term. You can then use this to jump through results in the text without having to scroll through looking for highlights.
	•	To search for a phrase or word in a single document, use the Find panel (Cmd-F or Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find…).
The different search fields are briefly described below.
Toolbar Quick Search Field
The toolbar Quick Search field works like the search field-cum-address bar in Safari, in that as you type, it brings up a list of results in a menu beneath it. Clicking on a result opens it in the editor. This searches document titles, synopses and text, showing the top 10 results for each.
Toolbar Magnifying Glass Button
The magnifying glass button in the toolbar provides quick access to a number of search tools. Click on the magnifying glass to bring up the Project Search field. Or, click on the arrow next to it to bring up a menu of other search tools.
Project Search
Project search is the most comprehensive way of searching for something in the project. It allows you to search for documents containing a particular word, phrase, label, keyword and more. We already covered how to use this in the section on “The Binder” when learning “The Basics”. Here are some extra tips:
	1.	Along with the magnifying glass button in the toolbar, you can also access this from the menu via Edit &gt; Find &gt; Search in Project (Shift-Cmd-F).
	2.	Clicking on the magnifying glass in the left of the search field that appears when using Project Search brings up a menu containing various options. For instance, here you can choose to search only for keywords, or only for a particular label.
	3.	Holding down Option or Command on the keyboard while clicking on an option in the “Search In” section of the menu allows you to choose more than one option. By doing this you could, for example, search in both synopses and notes but nowhere else.
To close the search results, click on the “X” in the search results header bar:
#

To hide the search bar, click on the magnifying glass in the toolbar again.
Finding Text in a Document
To find text inside a document, use the Find panel, which is available from the Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find… (Cmd-F) or by clicking on the arrow next to the magnifying glass in the toolbar and choosing “Search in Document”.
Other Find Tools
Other find tools can be found in the Edit &gt; Find menu, such as Find by Formatting, which allows you to search the text for particular formatting (e.g. italics).
Filtering the Outliner and Corkboard
When the focus is in the outliner or corkboard, going to Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find… (Cmd-F) will bring up a filter bar at the top of the editor. You can use this to search for items inside the outliner or corkboard. As you type in the search field or change the filter options, the outliner or corkboard will update to show only the documents that meet the given criteria. Note:
	•	Click the disclosure triangle next to the search field to reveal the options.
	•	Click “Done” to remove the filter.</Text>

            <Text>Scrivener features a “Linguistic Focus” feature that allows you to fade out other text in the editor except for certain speech types. For instance, you can fade out everything except your adverbs, to check for overuse.
You can bring up the Linguistic Focus panel by going to Edit &gt; Writing Tools &gt; Linguistic Focus… in the main menu. Then simply select a part of speech to focus on.
This feature uses linguistic analysis tools that are built into macOS, but it also adds something else: dialogue focus. Selecting “Direct Speech” as the focus will fade out all text except for that contained between speech marks. If you are writing a novel or story, this is a great way of checking the flow of a conversation you have written without being distracted by all of the action and attributions.</Text>

            <Text>One last thing to note before I leave you to it: Scrivener auto-saves your work so you don’t have to worry about saving manually. Every time you make an edit to the project, Scrivener schedules a save, which will occur after a couple of seconds of inactivity. You can, however, force a save at any time by selecting File &gt; Save (Cmd-S).
And that’s it: you are now all set to start using Scrivener. If you want to go into more depth or explore a little more, look at the “Going Further” section. I recommend leaving that until after you’ve been using Scrivener a little, though (or just look through the topics and read any documents that catch your eye). Alternatively, take a look through the user manual (Help &gt; Scrivener Manual).
Experiment! You should be able to work out most things by playing with the program. If you have any problems, check out our knowledge base, or take a look at some of our tutorial videos on our web page:
http://scrivener.tenderapp.com/help/kb
http://www.literatureandlatte.com/videos.php
And of course, if you are still baffled, post a question on the user forums:
http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum
Likewise, if you encounter any bugs or glitches, no matter how small—and especially if you experience a crash—please post to the forums or e-mail us at mac.support@literatureandlatte.com.
I hope you enjoy using Scrivener and find it a useful tool, and offer my heartfelt thanks to you for choosing Scrivener (or considering it) as the tool for your own writing.

            <Text>The document you are reading now is a folder. As mentioned, there’s no significant difference between text and folder documents. The differences are as follows:
	1.	They have different icons: folder icons are blue, and text document icons are white rectangles.
	⁃	Note that the folder icon for this document (“Get Organised”) has a little text icon in its corner. This signifies that this folder contains text—this text. (The text icon has nothing to do with the folder having text documents inside it, such as “Splitting the Editor” and so on—it means that this folder document itself contains text.)
	2.	Folder documents always have “disclosure triangles” next to them in the binder even when they have no subdocuments.
	3.	By default, folders and text documents open in different view modes in the editor. As you saw, this folder opened in corkboard mode before you turned the corkboard off.
We’ll come to this third point shortly—first, though, let’s look at how you can view more than one document at the same time.
Select “Splitting the Editor” in the binder (you may need to expand “Get Organised” by clicking on the disclosure triangle next to it). Or go get a cup of tea and a biscuit and come back here when you’re ready—I’ll wait!</Text>

            <Title>Splitting the Editor</Title>
            <Synopsis>View two documents alongside one another.</Synopsis>
            <Text>When working on a long piece of writing, you may want to refer to research or other parts of the manuscript. In Scrivener, you can split the main editor into two and have different documents (or the same document) open in each.
Let’s try that now by going to View &gt; Editor Layout &gt; Split Horizontally.
Alternatively, click on the button in the right of the editor header view (the square with the horizontal line through its middle):
#
This document is now displayed in two panes.
Note:
	•	Through the View &gt; Editor Layout menu, you can switch to a vertical (side-by-side) split or remove the split to return to a single editor.
	•	Option-clicking on the split button in the header view toggles between horizontal and vertical split mode. (Make sure the editor is split horizontally for this tutorial - the button splits vertically by default.)
	•	Clicking on the split button in the header view when there is a split removes the split, returning to single editor mode.
Now let’s load a different document in one of the editors:
Select any document in the binder, and it will be shown in the editor that currently has the focus. (You can tell which editor currently has the focus because when there is a split, the header bar of the focussed editor takes on the system accent colour.)
You can also drag a document from the binder to the header view of the editor in which you wish to view it. Let’s do that now:
	1.	Make sure that this document, “Splitting the Editor”, is visible in the bottom pane.
	2.	Drag “Sunset” from inside the “Research” folder onto the header view of the top pane.
You can use the split view to view any two documents in Scrivener alongside one another, allowing you to refer to a text, PDF, image or media document in one editor while typing in another.
Try loading different documents into the other editor now. Remember, you can do this in two ways:
	•	Drag a document from the binder to the header view of the other editor.
	•	Click into the editor you want to use so that its header changes colour, and then select a document in the binder.
Tip: Double-clicking on the central divider will resize the two editors so that they are of equal height or width.
Before moving on, let’s close the other editor. Do this by clicking on the square button next to the up/down arrows in the right of the header view above this editor. (Clicking this button when there is already a split tells Scrivener to get rid of the split and remove the other editor.)
Next, click on “Editor View Modes”.</Text>

            <Title>The Outliner</Title>
            <Text>The outliner allows you to see sections of the binder in more detail. It works like the binder, showing an indented list of documents that can be expanded and collapsed, but, unlike the binder, it can show synopses and other information—as the name suggests, it’s a great way of working with an outline of your manuscript. Let’s take a look at it:
	1.	Click into the upper editor pane (which should still show the corkboard) so that it receives the focus (its header bar using the system accent colour), and then click on the “Draft” folder in the binder.
	2.	Select the “Outliner” segment of the view mode control in the toolbar.
The upper editor now shows an outline of all items contained inside the Draft folder (because that is what we selected in the binder). Click on a disclosure triangle next to one of the folders to reveal more documents (or Opt-click on a disclosure triangle to open all subfolders inside the folder).
Using the Outliner
	•	The “Title and Synopsis” column shows (surprise, surprise) the title and synopsis of each document.
	⁃	Double-click into a title or synopsis to edit it.
	•	If a document has no title and no synopsis, the first lines of its text will be displayed. If there is no text, “Untitled” placeholder text will be shown.
	⁃	Double-click into the placeholder to add a title.
	⁃	Hit return to add a synopsis after you have typed the title.
	⁃	If you only want a synopsis and no title, hit return as soon as you double-click into the row, to leave the title area blank.
	•	If a document has a title but no synopsis, only the title will be shown.
	⁃	In this case, to add a synopsis, double-click the title to edit and hit return at the end of the title to start typing a synopsis.
	•	If a document has a synopsis but no title, only the synopsis will be shown.
	⁃	In this case, when you double-click into the synopsis to edit it, a blank title line will appear above the synopsis so that you can add a title if you wish. When you finish editing, if you didn’t add a title, the title line will disappear again.
	•	You can drag, drop and remove documents just as you can in the binder.
	•	You can move items around using the keyboard shortcuts found in the Edit &gt; Move menu.
Tip: The button on the right of the outliner footer bar (showing an icon of three dots and lines) allows you to show and hide synopses.
Outliner Options
	•	Determine which columns are shown by clicking on the “&gt;” button in the top-right of the outliner title bar, or via the View &gt; Outliner Options menu. The outliner can show as much or as little information as you want.
	•	Outliner columns can be sorted by clicking on the column headers:
	⁃	Click once to sort in ascending order.
	⁃	Click again to sort in descending order.
	⁃	Click a third time to remove the sort.

Right, on to scrivenings mode—make sure the focus is in the bottom editor again (by clicking into it if necessary) and then select “Scrivenings” in the binder.</Text>

            <Title>Default Formatting</Title>
            <Text>Changing the Default Formatting for New Documents
You can change the default formatting used for new documents like this:
	1.	In the editor, set up some text with the formatting you want to use for all new documents, and ensure the cursor is inside it.
	2.	From the main menu, select Scrivener &gt; Preferences…
	3.	Select “Editing” in the toolbar.
	4.	Select the “Formatting” tab.
	5.	Click the “Use Formatting in Current Editor” button.
From now on, whenever you create a new blank document and start typing, the text will the formatting you set up in (1).
Alternatively, instead of setting up the text in the editor, you can set the formatting in the text area of the Editing &gt; Formatting pane in the Preferences.
Changing the Default Formatting for Only a Single Project
Sometimes, you may have a project that needs to use different default formatting from other projects. You can set this up as follows:
	1.	From the main menu, select Project &gt; Project Settings…
	2.	Select “Formatting” in the sidebar.
	3.	Set up the text in the “Main Text Formatting” text area, or click on the “Use Current” button to use the formatting in the current editor.
NOTE: This tutorial is set up to use this option.
Applying Default Formatting to Existing Documents
Setting the default formatting in the Preferences or Project Settings has no effect on existing documents. (Scrivener could ruin special formatting you have applied if it changed the formatting for all your documents automatically every time you changed the preferences.) To apply the default formatting to existing documents:
	1.	In the binder, select the documents you want to update.
	2.	From the main menu, select Documents &gt; Convert &gt; Text to Default Formatting…
	3.	Check the options in the panel that appears and then click “OK”.

            <Title>Using Bookmarks for Project Notes</Title>
            <Text>In “The Basics”, we learned about how Bookmarks can be used to store references to other documents. In this section, we’ll learn how to use them in combination with Quick Reference Panels as a powerful way of managing project-wide notes.
Note: Be sure to read the section on Quick Reference Panels before reading this section!
First, we’re going to create a folder in the binder that we’ll use to store project notes:
	1.	In the binder, select the “Research” folder.
	2.	Click the “new folder” button in the binder footer bar (the icon of a folder with a “+” inside it).
	3.	Name the new folder “Notes”.
	4.	Ensuring the new “Notes” folder is selected, go to Edit &gt; Move &gt; Move Left. This will move the folder so that it is on the same level as and directly below the “Research” folder.
	5.	If you want, give the folder a custom notebook icon by going to Documents &gt; Change Icon.
Next, we’ll add some notes to the folder and then add them to the project bookmarks:
	1.	With the folder selected, click the “+” button in the binder footer to create a couple of new documents inside it. Name them anything you like, and feel free to type in them.
	2.	Select both documents and drag them onto the red “Bookmarks” icon in the toolbar. This will add them to the project bookmarks list. (Click on the “Bookmarks” toolbar icon to check that the documents have been added.)
Now we’ll open up a Quick Reference panel and navigate between our notes:
	1.	Select one of the documents you just created and then click the “Quick Ref” toolbar icon, so that the document is opened in its own Quick Reference panel.
	⁃	Alternatively, drag the document and drop it on the “Quick Ref” icon—this will open it in a Quick Reference panel without also opening it in the editor.
	2.	Click the bookmark icon in the left of the footer bar in the Quick Reference panel. This will open a sidebar showing all project bookmarks, including the two note documents you just added.
You can now select documents in the Bookmarks sidebar to navigate between them in the Quick Reference panel. This is a great way of referring to notes and research in their own window. And of course, you’re not limited to adding documents only from your “Notes” folder—you can add documents from anywhere in the project. (You can also refer to project bookmarks in the inspector, as we saw in “The Basics”.)
To create a new document and add it to the project bookmarks in a single step:
	1.	Click the “+” button in the footer bar beneath the Bookmarks sidebar of the Quick Reference window. A drop-down panel will appear, asking you where you want the new document to be created.
	2.	From the pop-up menu, choose the “Notes” folder you created earlier, and then click on “OK”.
	⁃	If you tick “Don’t ask again”, from now on when you create a new document in the Bookmarks sidebar of a Quick Reference panel, you won’t see this drop-down panel and the document will automatically be created in the folder you previously selected. You can change these settings at any time in the “Special Folders” area of Project Settings (available from the Project menu).
	3.	Name the new document.
A new document will be created inside the “Notes” folder, and it will automatically be added to the Project Bookmarks. You can drag items around in the Bookmarks sidebar of the Quick Reference panel to reorder them (this only reorders the Bookmarks, and not the placement of documents in the binder).
Note: Anything you add to the “Notes” folder in the binder will not automatically be added to the Project Bookmarks, because you can bookmark anything in the project. So if you create notes in the “Notes” folder in the binder and want them added to the Project Bookmarks, be sure to drag them to the “Bookmarks” toolbar icon or Ctrl-click on them and add them to the bookmarks from the contextual menu that appears.
Using a QuickReference panel in combination with Project Bookmarks is therefore a great way of creating and keeping track of notes on your project. And you can remove notes from the Bookmarks list once you’re finished with them while keeping them in the binder for future reference.</Text>

            <Title>Chapter Numbering and Placeholders</Title>
            <Text>Sometimes you will want numbers to appear in the text whose value may change depending on the arrangement of the text. For instance, you might want to title a document “Chapter 1”, but if you move it later, it might become “Chapter 2”. For this, you can use “placeholders”.
To insert an auto-number placeholder, go to Insert &gt; Auto-Number in the main menu and pick a number type. A tag will be inserted into the text. For example, if you select “1, 2, 3, 4, 5…”, the following tag will be inserted:
&lt;$n&gt;
This tag will be replaced with a number when using Compile. There are many other placeholders you can use in Scrivener—a full list is available from Help &gt; List of All Placeholders…
You can use placeholders in the text, in document titles, or in your own Compile formats. Many of the Compile formats provided with Scrivener use placeholders to insert chapter numbering. To see this, try the following:
	1.	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	2.	Select “Manuscript (Times)” from the Formats sidebar.
	3.	Click on the “+” button in the footer.
	4.	Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…” from the menu that appears. The Compile window will change to show the options for creating a format.
	5.	Ensure “Section Layouts” is selected in the sidebar.
	6.	Select “Chapter Heading” in the section layouts list.
	7.	Select the “Title Options” tab.
You will see that the “Title Prefix” text box contains the following text:
Chapter &lt;$t:chapter&gt;

This is what adds “Chapter One”, “Chapter Two” and so on to the start of each chapter when you use the “Manuscript (Times)” format to compile your manuscript.</Text>

            <Title>Document Templates</Title>
            <Text>Note: Make sure you go through the Custom Icons section before reading this section, so that you have a “Characters” folder set up.
One of the philosophies behind Scrivener is that it doesn’t force you into a particular workflow. You can write any sort of long-form text in Scrivener, setting up your project to fit the task at hand. Therefore, Scrivener doesn’t assume that everyone writing a novel (for example) uses character sheets to keep track of character information, or prompt sheets for information about locations. Instead, Scrivener provides the means to set up “document templates” that can generate items such as character sheets for those who use them.
Document templates allow you to set up a document in the project and use it as the basis for creating new documents. Let’s try creating a couple to see how this works.
	1.	Go to the Project menu and select New From Template. Note how there is just a dummy menu item in there saying “No templates folder set for project”.
	2.	Click the arrow next to the green “+” icon in the toolbar. You’ll see there are three items in there: “New Text”, “New Folder” and “Import Web Page” (which will be disabled if a document contained in the Draft folder is selected in the binder, because you can’t import web pages into the text-only Draft folder). Don’t select anything—we’re just looking at what’s there at the moment.
We’re going to add a couple of different types of document to these menus.
Next, take a look inside the “Research” folder in the binder (expand it if necessary by clicking the disclosure triangle next to it). Inside it you will find a “Sheets” folder, which contains two documents, “Character Sheet” and “Location Sheet”. Take a look at these documents. They contain text that could be used for very basic character or location sheets, which you might fill in for each character or location you are going to write about in a novel.
These documents are just regular text documents—you can type whatever you want in there. To see what I mean, select the “Location” document and then click on “+” in the toolbar so that a new blank document gets created. Name it to anything you want, and then type something inside the document.
Setting a Templates Folder
Now we’re going to tell Scrivener that the documents inside the “Sheets” folder should be treated as document templates—that is, that we want to be able to create new documents based on them:
	1.	Go to Project &gt; Project Settings…
	2.	Select “Special Folders” in the sidebar.
	3.	Under “Templates Folder”, select the “Sheets” folder from the pop-up menu.
The icon of the “Sheets” folder will change to be a white “T” against a blueprint background, and the “T” will also appear in the corner of each document inside it. This indicates that the folder is now acting as the project’s templates folder and that anything inside it can be used as the basis for a new document.
What does this mean? Let’s try returning to the menus we looked at a moment ago:
	1.	Click the “Characters” folder with the custom icon that you created when looking at Custom Icons. It should currently be empty.
	2.	Go to the Project menu and select New From Template again. You’ll notice that it’s no longer empty—it now shows the contents of the “Sheets” templates folder.
	3.	From the menu, select “Character Sheet”. A new document will be created inside the “Characters” folder—a document identical to the “Character Sheet” document in the templates folder. Change the title and edit the text in the document itself.
	4.	Now click the arrow next to the green “+” button in the toolbar. This time there will be more items in the menu that appears—the contents of our templates folder is there, too. This time choose “Location Sheet”.
The two new documents you just created are copies of the documents in the templates folder. And that’s really all the templates folder is—somewhere for you to put documents that you want to use as the basis for other documents, and which, in combination with the New From Template menu, makes it very easy to create copies of those documents anywhere you want in the project.
Set Folders to Use Templates by Default
That “Characters” folder we created earlier is there to hold character sheets for all the characters in our novel. At the moment, every time we want to add a new character sheet to it, we have to use the New From Template menu. There’s an easier way, though:
	1.	Select the “Characters” folder in the binder.
	2.	Go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments in the main menu.
	3.	Select “Character Sheet”.
Now try pressing the green “+” button in the toolbar or the “+” button at the bottom of the binder. See what happens? The “Characters” folder now automatically uses the “Character Sheet” template whenever you create a new document inside it, without you having to use the New From Template menu each time</Text>
        </Document>
        <Document ID="BD51CEFB-04E0-4CC3-9DCA-728DE9DA40A9">
            <Title>View Multiple Groups</Title>
            <Text>You aren’t limited to displaying the contents of only one group in the corkboard or outliner—you can show the subdocuments of several groups by “stacking” them. This is really easy to do:
	1.	Split the editor horizontally or vertically.
	2.	Click into the other editor to give it the focus.
	3.	Select “The Basics” in the binder.
	4.	Switch to corkboard mode if necessary.
	5.	Hold down the Command key and click on “Going Further” in the binder.
	6.	With the Command key still held down, click on “Tips” in the binder.
Now scroll down through the corkboard. Note how the subdocuments of each of the folders you selected are all displayed on the corkboard, with a dividing line between each section.
When viewing a stack of groups in the corkboard like this, the footer view shows a button that allows you to chose whether to display the sections as a grid (the default), in rows, or in columns:
#

Try clicking on each of the different options to see how they affect the corkboard.
Now try switching to outliner mode. You’ll see the three groups you selected in the binder, and you can expand them to view their contents.</Text>

            <Title>Syncing with iOS</Title>
            <Text>Scrivener is also available for iOS so that you can write and structure while on your iPhone or iPad. The iOS version is available as a separate purchase from the App Store. Below we cover how to sync between platforms for those who also own the iOS version. If you don’t have Scrivener for iPhone or iPad, you can ignore this section.
Setting Up Dropbox on Your Mac
You need to store any projects you wish to sync on Dropbox. You can get a free Dropbox account from http://www.getdropbox.com. You’ll need to download the Dropbox app and install it on your Mac. Assuming you have Dropbox installed on your Mac:
	1.	Locate any Scrivener projects you want to sync in the Finder.
	⁃	Tip: You can easily locate any project by opening it in Scrivener and then selecting File &gt; Show Project in Finder from the main menu.
	2.	Ensure any projects you want to sync are closed. This is very important—if you leave any projects open in Scrivener while moving them into Dropbox, you could end up corrupting them and losing data.
	3.	In the Finder, open another window (File &gt; New Finder Window in the Finder menu) and open your Dropbox folder in it (select “Dropbox” in the Finder sidebar).
	4.	Create a folder in which to store the projects you wish to sync with iOS. To sync, you must have a folder on Dropbox that you use only for sharing Scrivener projects between devices. The standard folder that the iOS version uses is /Apps/Scrivener, so if you want to use that, inside the Dropbox folder you would create a new folder named “Apps” (if it doesn’t already exist) and then inside that you would create a folder called “Scrivener”. However, you can create and use any folder you want for this, just as long as you only use it for storing Scrivener projects. (The reason you should only store Scrivener projects inside it is that everything in this folder will be synced to your iOS device, so anything else in the folder would take up unnecessary space on your device.)
	5.	Move the projects you located in (1) into the folder you created in (4), for instance by dragging and dropping them.
	6.	At this point, you can reopen the projects (e.g. by double-clicking on them in the Finder).
When creating a new project, if you want to sync it with iOS, be sure to save it into the Dropbox folder you created in (4) when asked where to choose a location for the new project. (If you don’t, you can still move it later using the steps above.)
Setting Up Dropbox on Your iPad or iPhone
Next, open Scrivener on your iPhone and do the following:
	1.	Tap the “sync” icon at the top of the projects screen and select Link Dropbox. As long as you have an internet connection, this will bring up the Dropbox sign-in window, allowing you to sign in to your Dropbox account.
	2.	Once you’ve signed in, you’ll be asked to choose a folder on Dropbox with which to sync your Scrivener projects. Be sure to choose the folder you set up in step (4) of “Setting Up Dropbox on Your Mac”.
	⁃	Note: You can change this folder at any time by tapping “Edit” in the nav bar at the top of the projects screen, then tapping the # / # icon (depending on macOS version) in the footer bar that appears and selecting Dropbox Settings.
	3.	Once you’ve chosen a folder, Scrivener will sync with Dropbox, downloading any files you have placed in your shared Dropbox folder. Projects stored on Dropbox will appear in their own section at the top of the projects list.
When you create a new project on iOS, you will be asked where to save it. If you choose to save it to Dropbox, after you sync, it will automatically appear in the Dropbox folder you created on your Mac, so that you can open the project there, too.
Making Changes to Projects
Now that you have your project on both your Mac and iOS device, you need to make sure it is synced between devices whenever you make changes. Here’s how:
	1.	On macOS, the Dropbox app you downloaded from dropbox.com is always running in the background. Whenever a file is changed in the Dropbox folder, the Dropbox app automatically uploads it to the Dropbox servers. Whenever the Dropbox app detects new files on the Dropbox servers, it automatically downloads them to the Dropbox folder on your Mac. Whenever it is uploading or downloading files, it shows a “syncing” badge in the Dropbox icon in the menu bar:
	⁃	#
	2.	When you’ve finished editing on your Mac and want to open the project on iOS, it is very important that you wait for the “syncing” badge to disappear from the Dropbox icon in the Mac menu bar. Only when it disappears have all the files uploaded to the Dropbox servers. Until then, there is no way for the iOS version to download all of your changes, so if you don’t wait, you could end up with an incomplete sync and files missing from your project.
	3.	Once you’re sure Dropbox has finished syncing on your Mac, on your iOS device, open Scrivener and tap the “sync” icon in the nav bar of the projects screen. A progress bar will appear while the updated files download.
	4.	Once the sync has finished, you are ready to open and edit the project on your iOS device.
	5.	When you’ve finished making edits on iOS, tap the “sync” icon once again in the projects screen. (The sync icon is also available in the nav bar while editing documents inside a project, and in the share button in the footer bar of the editor.) Once again, a progress bar will appear, this time to indicate that your changed files are being uploaded to the Dropbox servers. Wait for the sync to complete.
	6.	When you return to your Mac, if the project is still open, a message should appear telling you that changes have been made and asking if you want to sync them. Before clicking to start the sync, though, make sure that the Dropbox app has finished downloading all the changed files. As you did before syncing on iOS, check the Dropbox icon in the menu bar on your Mac and do not tell Scrivener to sync the changes until the “syncing” badge has disappeared. Once you are sure Dropbox has finished syncing, tell Scrivener to sync the changes. The project will close and reopen automatically, now with all the changes you made on iOS in place.
	⁃	If you don’t see a message telling you that there are changes, you can go to File &gt; Sync &gt; with Mobile Devices to force Scrivener to look for changes.
	⁃	If the project was closed, only reopen it when you are sure Dropbox has finished syncing. When you open the project, all of the changes you made on iOS will be there.
Resolving Sync Problems
If your iOS device tells you that a project you downloaded from your Mac seems to be invalid, it is most likely because you didn’t let Dropbox on macOS finish syncing all files before you downloaded them to iOS. To solve this issue, ensure the Dropbox app has finished syncing on your Mac, and then tap “sync” again on iOS to download the rest of the files.
Try not to edit a project on both devices without syncing, as this can lead to conflicts. For instance, suppose you make some changes on iOS, and then return to your Mac and make some changes to the project without first tapping “sync” in iOS and waiting for Dropbox to download the changes to your Mac. In this case, conflicts will arise. Scrivener will do its best to resolve such conflicts, but it’s always better to try to avoid this happening.

            <Text>You can assign any file or folder a custom icon via Documents &gt; Change Icon. Some of the documents in this project have custom icons assigned, such as the folders using yellow book icons and the “START HERE” document, among others.
To see this feature in action, let’s try setting up another root folder in which we will store information about characters:
	1.	Lock the editor so that this document stays on screen (Ctrl-click in the header bar and select “Lock In Place”).
	2.	Select the “Research” folder in the binder.
	3.	Click on the “add folder” button in the footer bar at the bottom of the binder.
	4.	A new folder is created inside the “Research” folder. Rename the new folder “Characters”.
	5.	From the Edit menu, choose Move &gt; Left. Your new folder is now a root folder—that is, it is now as far left as it can go, on the same level as the Draft, Research and Trash folders.
Our new “Characters” folder looks fairly generic so far, and this is where the custom icon feature comes in. In our example, we are going to use our new folder to store notes about different characters in a novel, so we want to assign it an appropriate icon:
	1.	Select the “Characters” folder.
	2.	Go to Documents &gt; Change Icon (or Ctrl-click on the folder and select “Change Icon” from the contextual menu).
	3.	Choose Characters &gt; Photo (or any icon you want).
If you create a Scrivener project from one of the templates that are provided (such as the novel template), you will find folders in the binder that have been created and customised in just this way.

            <Title>Editor View Modes</Title>
            <Synopsis>How to switch between the editor, corkboard and outliner, and how to view multiple documents as though they were a single text.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Scrivener’s editor has four possible modes—four different ways of viewing your work. Learning how and when to switch between them will make your Scrivener experience much more productive. You switch between these modes using the View Mode control in the toolbar, which looks like this:
#
Why are there only three icons if there are four view modes, I hear you ask? Good question! Here’s why:
	•	When you are viewing a single document that has no subdocuments (that is, a document that is not a group or folder with other documents inside it), there are only three modes.
	•	An extra mode (called “scrivenings”) is available for groups.
	•	When you are viewing a group, the fourth mode is accessed by turning off the other modes (just as you turned off the corkboard to see the text associated with “Get Organised” not long ago).
That’s going to make a lot more sense if we go through the modes!
1. Single Document Mode
In single document mode, the editor shows the content of the current document. So, if you’re looking at a text document (or folder), you’ll be looking at its text; for an image document, single document mode shows the actual image. The editor is in single document mode right now. In this mode, the view mode control in the toolbar looks like this:
#
Note how the leftmost icon shows a single page, and that it’s selected.
2. Corkboard Mode
In corkboard mode, the editor shows the subdocuments of the current document as index cards on a corkboard. Let’s take a look at how that works right now:
	•	Select the “Get Organised” folder in the binder, and then click on the corkboard icon (the middle button) in the view mode control to select it:
#
Once you’ve taken a look at the corkboard, return here. See how the subdocuments of the folder you selected appeared as index cards?
(You might also note how the icon in the left button changes to show two pages rather than one page when viewing a group—we’ll get to that presently.)
	•	Next (after you’ve read this bit, so you know how to get back), click the corkboard icon again, but this time while viewing the document you are reading right now. You will see that the corkboard is blank. This is because this document (“Editor View Modes”) doesn’t contain any subdocuments—but it could: you could drag documents into the blank corkboard or add some using the “+” button.
	•	Click the text icon on the left of the view mode control to see the text of this document again:
#

3. Outliner Mode
Like corkboard mode, outliner mode shows the subdocuments of the current document, but it presents them as rows with various columns of information. Try repeating everything you did for the corkboard mode above, but this time, instead of selecting the corkboard icon, click the outliner icon on the right (and remember to come back here afterwards):
#

4. Scrivenings Mode
“Scrivenings” is the term for Scrivener’s combined text mode, and it is one of Scrivener’s coolest features. It allows you to view or edit multiple text documents as though they were a single document. Scrivenings mode is available in the following circumstances:
	1.	When a group is selected in the binder (a folder or any document containing subdocuments).
	2.	When more than one document is selected in the binder. (You can select multiple documents by holding down the Shift or Command keys.)
If you look at the view mode control in the toolbar at the moment, you will see that the left-most icon shows a single sheet of paper. This indicates that scrivenings mode is not available here, because you are viewing a single document that has no subdocuments. So, let’s look at one that does.
After reading this next part so that you know what to do, once more click on “Get Organised” in the binder. You will notice that the “View Mode” icon in the toolbar changes. (If you have set the toolbar to show text as well as icons, you will notice that it gets renamed, too, becoming “Group Mode” instead of “View Mode”.)
#
The single text icon on the left has now changed into two pieces of paper, representing a stack. This shows that it is possible to enter Scrivenings mode.
Let’s try that now: after clicking on “Get Organised” in the binder:
	1.	Click on the scrivenings group mode icon (the two pieces of paper).
	2.	Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the editor, glancing at the text it contains.
	3.	Return here either by clicking on “Editor View Modes” in the binder or by hitting the back button.
Done that? You should have seen that the text from all the various subdocuments of the “Get Organised” folder—including this one—were presented as a single, continuous document, with dividers marking the boundaries between them. You can edit text in Scrivenings mode just as you can when text documents are viewed in isolation.
Note: When you selected the “Get Organised” folder again, it opened in outliner mode because Scrivener remembers which mode you last used to view a group. Whenever you change the group mode, the new mode will automatically be used for groups until you change it again.
View Modes and Selections
You’ve now switched between all the main view modes. The main thing to remember is that the view modes available depend on what has been loaded into the editor from the binder:
	•	When one document with no subdocuments is loaded into the editor, there are three view modes available:
	⁃	Single document mode (view the document content, such as its text).
	⁃	Corkboard mode.
	⁃	Outliner mode.
	•	When a folder or a document with subdocuments is loaded into the editor, there are four view modes:
	⁃	Scrivenings mode.
	⁃	Corkboard mode.
	⁃	Outliner mode.
	⁃	Single document mode. In this case, you access single document mode by turning off the other view modes—that is, by clicking on the selected button in the view mode control to deselect it.
	•	When multiple documents are selected in the binder (by Shift- or Command-clicking on them), there are three view modes available:
	⁃	Scrivenings mode. (In this case, single document mode is not available because the editor is not displaying a single document.)
	⁃	Corkboard mode.
	⁃	Outliner mode.
Tip: You can also switch between view modes using the top three items in the View menu, or using the Cmd-1, Cmd-2 and Cmd-3 keyboard shortcuts.
I know, I know—now you really do need that cup of tea, and probably another biscuit too. Once you’re done, now that you know how to switch between view modes, let’s take a closer look at them. Click on “The Corkboard” when you’re ready.</Text>

            <Text>Click on the Bookmarks button in the inspector header bar (the second icon).
The Bookmarks pane allows you to store references to other documents in the project, on your hard-disk, or on the internet.
To add a new bookmark, do one of the following:
	•	Click the # or # button (depending on which version of macOS you are runing)  above the Bookmarks list.
	•	Drag a document from the binder into the list.
	•	Drag a file from the Finder into the list.
	•	Drag a URL from a browser into the list.
Selecting a bookmark in the list opens the content of the bookmark in the lower half of the inspector. You can see that the “Key Concepts” document has been added as a bookmark for this document, and that its text can be viewed right there in the inspector. (Click on “Key Concepts” in the Bookmarks list at the top of the inspector if its contents are not visible.)
Double-click a bookmark to open it: external bookmarks open in their default application; internal bookmarks open inside Scrivener.
Bookmarks can be associated with either individual documents or the entire project: click the bar labelled “Document Bookmarks” to switch between Document Bookmarks (specific to the current document) and Project Bookmarks (available from any document).
Project Bookmarks
Project Bookmarks can also be accessed from the bookmarks icon in the toolbar, providing fast navigation to frequently-needed documents:
	•	Click the red bookmark icon in the toolbar. A list will appear. I have already added the “START HERE” document to the project bookmarks.
	•	Click “START HERE” in the list. The bookmarked document will be opened in the editor.
	•	Hit the back button in the header view to return here afterwards.

	1.	Ctrl-click on the header view to bring up the header bar menu.
	2.	Select “Lock in Place”.
The header bar will turn a different shade of grey, indicating that the editor is now “locked”. When an editor is locked, clicks in the binder have no effect on it.
If you have split the editor so that two editors are visible on screen, clicks in the binder will go to the unlocked editor, no matter where the focus is. (You can turn off this behaviour via the “Behaviors” Pane of the Preferences, under “Navigation” in the sidebar.)

            <Text>Scriptwriting mode is available from Format &gt; Scriptwriting &gt; Script Mode (Cmd-8).
When in script mode, the footer view will show information on the various available script elements.
	•	Select Format &gt; Scriptwriting &gt; Script Mode - Screenplay from the main menu now.
	⁃	The word and character count will disappear and you will see a pop-up menu appear on the right of the footer view saying “General Text” (this just means that the currently selected text isn’t recognised as a part of a screenplay).
	•	Click into the text on the line below:
Click into this text.
	•	Try selecting different elements from the pop-up menu on the right of the footer view.
The above text is automatically reformatted to the script element you select each time.
You can switch between script elements using the tab and enter keys:
	•	Hitting enter at the end of the line will take you to the next element.
	•	Hitting tab at the beginning of the line will toggle between different elements.
	•	For some elements, hitting tab at the end of a line will take you to a different element on the next line from hitting enter. For other elements, hitting tab might insert characters.
	⁃	For example, hitting tab at the end of a dialogue line will move to a parenthetical line, whereas hitting tab in a scene heading line will insert a hyphen, ready for you to type the location.
The footer view updates to show what will happen if you press the tab or enter keys (which will move you to the next script element).
Note that scriptwriting mode is saved on a document-by-document basis, so you can switch between documents that use script formatting and documents that don’t. Documents using scriptwriting mode have a yellow icon to distinguish them from other text documents.
To turn off script mode, us the Script Mode menu item again, deselecting it.
A number of script formats are provided, such as screenplay, stage play and comic script formats. You can also create your own via Format &gt; Scriptwriting &gt; Script Settings…</Text>

            <Title>Dark Mode</Title>
            <Text>If you’re running on macOS 10.14 Mojave or above, you will notice that Scrivener fully supports macOS’s dark mode. Scrivener’s interface will automatically switch to a dark appearance whenever you choose “Dark” for the “Appearance” in System Preferences. You can also determine Scrivener’s appearance independently of the System Preferences as follows:
	•	From the Scrivener &gt; Appearance menu, choose “Dark” to force Scrivener to use a dark appearance at all times, even when the system is using a light appearance.
	•	From the Scrivener &gt; Appearance menu, choose “Light” to force Scrivener to use a light appearance at all times, even when the system is using a dark appearance.
To reset these options, simply choose “System Default” from the Scrivener &gt; Appearance menu. Scrivener will return to using whichever appearance is set in the System Preferences.
When in Dark Mode, you can further choose whether the main text areas of project windows should use a light or dark appearance. Using a light appearance for the main editors allows you to see custom text colours exactly as they would appear when compiled; using a dark appearance provides a fully dark environment across the entire interface.
To switch between light and dark editors, change the “Keep Main Editors Light” setting in the Scrivener &gt; Appearance menu (only available in Dark Mode), or use the keyboard shortcut Shift-Cmd-Opt-L.</Text>

            <Title>Scrivener's File Format</Title>
            <Text>Scrivener projects are saved on disk as files with the extension “.scriv” and are actually package files. A “package file” is a file that is really a folder, but which looks like, and is treated like, a file by the macOS file system.
To see what I mean, try the following:
	1.	Ctrl-click on a .scriv file in the Finder.
	2.	Select “Show Package Contents” from the contextual menu that appears.
The Finder now shows the innards of your .scriv package. Take a look inside the “Files/Data” folder, for instance.
You will (reassuringly, I hope) discover that all of your work is stored as multiple RTF and XML files inside various subfolders. This means that even in the worst possible crash case, if a .scriv file became hopelessly corrupted (although I hope this will never happen), you would still be able to open and edit all of your work in another program that supports RTF files.
That said, you should not edit the RTF files inside a .scriv package in any other program if you intend to keep using them inside Scrivener, as this may cause problems in Scrivener. Use the Export Files feature if you want to get your individual files out for use with another program.</Text>

            <Title>Importing Files</Title>
            <Text>Importing Files
To bring in writing and research from other apps:
	1.	In Scrivener’s binder, select the folder into which you wish to import the new files. Or, select the file under which you wish the files to be imported. (If you select a folder, the imported files will be placed inside it as the last items; if you select a file, imported files will be placed directly beneath it.)
	2.	Go to File &gt; Import &gt; Files… in the main menu.
	3.	In the file browser window that appears, select the files that you want to import.
	4.	Click “Import”.
All selected files and folders will be imported, including subdirectories, reproducing the file structure from the Finder in Scrivener’s binder. Imported text files will be converted so that they can be edited inside Scrivener. All other files will be copied into Scrivener.
Note: If you selected a folder or file contained inside the “Draft” folder in step (1) above, you will only have the option of importing text file types from the file browser, because the “Draft” folder only supports text files.
Scrivener can import many different file types:
	•	Word documents (.docx, .doc), rich text files (.rtf, .rtfd), plain text files (.txt), OpenOffice documents (.odt) and Final Draft files (.fdx) are imported as text that can be edited inside Scrivener.
	⁃	Note that we are unable to support the Apple Pages file format because Apple has not made the format public. To import documents from Pages, first export them from Pages as .docx files, and then import the .docx files into Scrivener.
	•	Image, movie, sound and PDF files are copied into Scrivener and can be viewed in its editor.
	•	All other files are copied into Scrivener and are displayed in the editor using macOS’s Quick Look viewer.
Importing Web Pages
You can import web pages by selecting Import &gt; Web Page… from the File menu.
Import and Split
Perhaps you have already written a long document and you want to bring it into Scrivener and break it up into smaller sections. You could do that by importing it following the steps above and then using the Split at Selection feature. Another option is to use Import and Split:
	1.	From the main menu, select Files &gt; Import &gt; Import and Split…
	2.	In the browser that appears, select the file that you wish to import.
	3.	In the “Sections are separated by” box, enter the text that represents splits in your document. For instance, you could use Insert &gt; Break &gt; Page Break to enter a page break character in here and have your document split at each new page. Or you could enter a couple of return characters, or a separator character you have used in the text (e.g. “#”).
	4.	For Final Draft files, you can choose which script element to split sections at—you will usually want to leave this as “Scene Heading”.
	5.	Click “Import”.
Your text will now be imported as multiple documents. Go through them and do any necessary clean-up. You can split them further using the Split at Selection feature.</Text>

            <Title>Typewriter Scrolling</Title>
            <Text>By default, composition mode uses “typewriter scrolling” (you’ll be notified of this every time you enter composition mode until you tick “Do not show again”). With this enabled, newly-typed text will remain in the vertical centre of the screen so that you don’t have to crick your neck by looking down all the time.
Typewriter scrolling works like this:
	•	When you type text in a new document, when there is enough text so that the line you are typing on would be lower than the middle of the screen, it is automatically scrolled up to keep it centred.
	•	If you edit text elsewhere on the screen, typewriter scrolling occurs wherever you type. This way, the text doesn’t jump around unexpectedly every time you fix a typo.
	•	When you want typewriter scrolling to occur in the middle of the screen again, hit Cmd-J (Edit &gt; Find &gt; Jump to Selection).
You can turn typewriter scrolling off by going to View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Typewriter Scrolling (Ctrl-Cmd-T). Using the same menu command, you can also turn it on for the editor when not in composition mode.
To test this feature out, enter composition mode (Opt-Cmd-F) and type some text inside this document (ensuring typewriter scrolling is turned on). Do that here, making sure you type enough text so that it wraps across more than one line:
Your text:
Keep typing so that there is enough text to fill the height of the screen.
Next, try moving the cursor into some text in the bottom quarter of the screen and type more than a line of text. You’ll see that the typing line stays at the same position.
Now, hit Cmd-J and carry on typing, once more making sure that you type enough text to wrap over another line or two. See how typing now sticks to the centre of the screen? As the text wraps to another line, it moves up to keep the line in which you are typing at the same position.
Tip: You can change the typewriter scrolling position via the “Editing” pane of the Preferences.</Text>

            <Text>Drag Text to the Binder
You can create new documents from sections of text in the editor as follows:
	1.	Select some text in the editor.
	2.	Click on the text and hold to begin a drag.
	3.	Drag the text into the binder.
A new document will be created containing the dragged text.
Drag Text from the Binder
You can insert the text of a binder document into another binder document like this:
	1.	In the editor, open the document into which you want to insert the text.
	2.	In the binder, locate the document whose text you wish to insert.
	3.	Drag the document from the binder into the editor, holding down the Option key on the keyboard as you drop.
The text of the document will be copied into the editor.</Text>

            <Title>Tracking Threads with Labels</Title>
            <Text>In “The Basics”, we covered how coloured labels can be assigned to documents, and how they can be used for anything. There’s a cool way of viewing labels that we didn’t cover when looking at the basics, though: labels can be displayed in threads on the corkboard view. The easiest way to understand how this works is to see it in action:
	1.	Split the editor if necessary.
	2.	In the other editor, load the “Writing and Editing” folder under “Going Further”.
	3.	Switch to corkboard mode. You should see several cards on the board.
	4.	From the main menu, select View &gt; Corkboard Options &gt; Show Label Colors Along Edges so that you can see the label colours in the corkboard. (You don’t need to do this, but it’s useful for this demonstration.)
	5.	Either select View &gt; Corkboard Options &gt; Arrange by Label from the main menu, or click on this button in the footer bar:
#
See what happens? Coloured lines appear stretching the width of the corkboard, each representing a label. Each card is placed on the line that corresponds to the label associated with its document, in the same order as it appears in the binder.
	•	Drag cards from left to right to change their positions in the binder.
	•	Drag cards up and down to change their labels.
	•	Switch between horizontal and vertical lines using the button in the footer bar.
If you’re writing a novel and use labels to keep track of the point-of-view character or subplot for each document, this is a great way of viewing all the threads in a group. (And combined with viewing multiple groups, you could even view threads for the entire manuscript.)</Text>

            <Title>Document Links</Title>
            <Text>Document links work much like web hyperlinks, except that they link to other documents in the project.
To create a document link:
	1.	Select the text to which you wish to apply the text. For instance, try highlighting “document link” in the next sentence:
	⁃	This is a document link.
	⁃	(You don’t have to select text. If there is no selection, the title of the linked document will be inserted with the link applied to it.)
	2.	Either:
	⁃	Go to Edit &gt; Link to Document and choose the document you wish to reference; Or:
	⁃	Drag a document from the binder onto the selected text.
	3.	Let’s try the latter: drag the “Revision Mode” document onto the text you selected above.
You can also choose New Link… from Edit &gt; Link to Document to bring up a sheet that allows you to create a new document to which to link.
Clicking on a document link opens the linked document in the other editor by default, creating a split if necessary. (Try clicking on the “split” in the previous sentence to see what I mean).
You can change this behaviour in the “Behaviors” pane of the Preferences, choosing where you would like links opened.</Text>

            <Synopsis>This is the synopsis.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Synopsis Index Card
At the top of the Notes pane of the inspector is a virtual index card, in which you can type a synopsis of your document (the header of the index card can be used to rename the document, too).
A core idea behind Scrivener is that every section of the project is associated with a synopsis which can be viewed either alongside the section text (in the inspector) or alongside other synopses (in the corkboard or outliner). This allows you to switch between an overview of your manuscript and its text.
Imagine it like this: each document in Scrivener is a sheet of paper with an index card clipped to it. You can scrawl a summary of the document onto the index card, and then you can take the card and lay it out alongside other index cards to work with the bigger picture. (We’ll see that bigger picture when we come to look at the corkboard and outliner views.)
Notes
Below the index card is the notes area, where you can jot down anything relating to the document that you don’t want in the text itself, such as ideas and problems.

This allows you to save the state of the interface and quickly return to it at a later time, either via the layouts panel or the Window &gt; Layouts menu.

            <Text>By default, Scrivener’s editor uses a “fixed width”, so that when the editor is expanded beyond a certain width, the text will appear as a column in its centre. If you would prefer the text to take up the full width of the editor, you can turn this behaviour off via the Preferences:
	1.	Go to Scrivener &gt; Preferences… in the main window.
	2.	Select the “Appearance” tab at the top.

            <Title>Freeform Corkboard Mode</Title>
            <Text>Scrivener’s corkboard is not like a real corkboard: on a real corkboard, you can pin cards anywhere; in Scrivener, the corkboard is a linear list of of a group’s subdocuments laid out in rows. However, there is a freeform mode, which allows you to place cards anywhere and experiment.
You switch between freeform and regular modes using the button on the right of the corkboard’s footer bar:
#

(You can also enter freeform mode by going to View &gt; Corkboard Options &gt; Freeform.)
Try this now:
	1.	Split the editor if necessary.
	2.	In the other editor, select a folder in the binder and switch to corkboard mode.
	3.	Click on the freeform mode button in the footer bar, as indicated in the image above.
You can now drag cards around and drop them anywhere. (Select multiple cards by clicking and dragging the mouse to create a marquee rectangle and enclosing the cards you wish to select.)
Dragging the cards around in freeform mode has no effect on the order of their associated documents in the binder (unlike in regular mode). If you arrange the cards in an order you would like to be used in the binder, though, you can click the “Commit” button in the footer bar and Scrivener will change the order of the documents in the binder to best fit their arrangement on the freeform corkboard.
Feel free to play around with the cards (but don’t hit “Commit” unless you want to mess up the order of the tutorial!), and once you have finished, return to regular corkboard mode by clicking on the grid icon on the left of the button you used to switch to freeform mode (or go to View &gt; Corkboard Options and deselect Freeform).

            <Title>Control the Other Editor</Title>
            <Text>The outliner and corkboard are not only great organisational tools: they can also be used to navigate, just like the binder, using the “Selection Affects Other Editor” tool:
	1.	Split the editor if necessary.
	2.	In the other editor, load any folder and switch to either corkboard or outliner mode.
Note the button containing an arrow pointing out of a box in the footer bar:
#
That’s the “Selection Affects Other Editor” button. Click on it now. You will notice that it changes colour, to indicate that it is on. When this button is on, selecting documents in the corkboard or outliner will open them in the other editor if there is a split.
Try clicking on one of the documents in the corkboard or outliner, and you will see that it is opened in this editor (come back here afterwards!). By turning this feature on, then, you can use the corkboard or outliner to navigate through the other editor.
Click the button again to deselect it (it will turn back grey to indicate that “Selection Affects Other Editor” has been turned off).
Navigating in Copyholders
Note: be sure to go through the section covering Copyholders in “Referring to More Documents” before reading this section.
You can use this same button to navigate documents using Copyholders. Try this:
	1.	Holding down Option on the keyboard, drag one of the documents in the corkboard or outliner and drop it onto the header bar above the corkboard or outliner. A Copyholder split will open within the other editor.
	2.	Now click on the “Selection Affects Other Editor” button again so that it changes colour, taking on the system accent colour. Then click it a second time. Now that a Copyholder is open, it will remain coloured on this second click, but the icon will change to show the arrow pointing into the box. This indicates that selection will now be opened in the Copyholder rather than in the other editor.
	3.	Now try selecting documents in the corkboard or outliner—see how they get opened in the Copyholder?
Hopefully you will see how useful this could be. For instance, here’s a setup I use quite regularly:
	•	Binder open on left.
	•	Editor split vertically.
	•	Right editor in outliner mode with its Copyholder open at the bottom
	•	“Selection Affects” button set to affect the Copyholder.
	•	Right editor Locked in Place (so that any clicks in the binder only affect the left editor).
With this arrangement, I can use the binder to navigate the editor on the left, and the outliner to navigate the Copyholder below it, arranging and editing my manuscript on the left while navigating through and referring to research and notes on the right.

            <Title>Splitting and Merging Documents</Title>
            <Text>Splitting Documents
Suppose you start out creating a single document for each chapter. Then, after your first draft, you realise that you want to break your chapters up into smaller sections, so that you can restructure more easily. No problem.
To split the text of a document into smaller pieces:
	1.	Click into the text at the point you wish to split it apart.
	2.	In the main menu, go to Documents &gt; Split &gt; at Selection. The document will be split in two at the cursor point.
Documents &gt; Split &gt; with Selection as Title works much the same way, except you select a range of text before using it. The selected text will become the title of the newly-created document.
Merging Documents
The opposite of splitting documents is merging them. If you have a number of small documents in the binder that you want to merge into a single document:
	1.	Select the documents you wish to merge in the binder.
	2.	From the main menu, choose Documents &gt; Merge.
